Scenario planning is rigorous but exciting technique in which people share information and judgment to create a picture of the future larger than any individual could produce alone. The technique has been used for two decades to distinguish certainties from uncertainties and thus develop descriptions of the future that help put present-day decisions into context. The process of generating scenarios is more interesting than the ultimate written descriptions; however, students learn to write crisp descriptions of significant potential future events, Material on systems dynamics and the unintended consequences of future events is included.

    "description": "The old industrial economy was built around the idea of scarce resources. The new information economy is built around that of endless resources; because you can replicate over and over without taking away anything from the original. When one starts to look at the building blocks for the new economy, everything changes, and we see instantly that Information Superhighway is a terrible metaphor. What's happening is only tangentially about technology; the important part is the consequences of-and the culture driving-the technology. The old model was essentially the convergence of the so-called \"3 Cs\": communications, computing, and content. We speak incessantly of the information infrastructure, but nobody knows at present what is to be communicated on that infrastructure. We must instead be looking at the consequences of the technologies and at the cultural logic driving the technologies. What then comes into view is a different Cs\": customization, community, and commerce. And this is really the info supermarket. We will have a community that is not organized around geography, but around common interests. We will have commerce where the ground rules about intellectual property, security, and privacy are still being written. This seminar, after presenting an introductory semiotic instrumentation, tries to present some of these ideas and engage their problematics.",

There are many questions: to what extent can ideas serve to bridge the media, and to what extent does each medium serve up its own message? How does the formal tension among the media create new possibilities for metamedia? How will the various media be transformed in their merging? Are we, in effect, moving toward the widespread adoption of what has been called hypermedia? What are the ethical dilemmas? What are the linguistic evolutions? To what extent does the computer provide new conceptual pathways, as well as modifying the aesthetic energy? How does the vast amount of data aid in the communications process, and hinder it?",

We might say that our situation is low, as the world seen, let us say, by a mouse. The mouse never has any sense of power or of elevation with respect to the things encountered. It is a prisoner of the floor- the floor scattered with obstacles it doesn't even know to be a vast architecture on behalf of entities unimaginable. Our world is struck with under-familiarity and yet over-attractiveness. So much to savor, we barely know we are \"short\" of things. To address this defect, the course constructs an alphabet-each letter a buzzword you be hearing, say, in 2001; each trying to give a glimpse of the upcoming shape of the world. Why an alphabet? The linguists used to say that alphabetic figures form a series; they never add up. They're distributed over a conceptual space, they are not integrative. One can say, with the Roland Barthes of A Lover's Discourse, that the postmodern perceiver, like the lover, speaks its world in a horizontal discourse. This means that the words, images, and sentiments available to it \"cannot be classified: organized, hierarchized, arranged with a view to an end (a settlement): There are no first figures [when you're in love],' Barthes wrote. \"You cannot configure your experience into a system\" -it's precisely that which the system (be it love or other turbulent change) frustrates.

The process of generating scenarios is more interesting than the ultimate written descriptions; however, students learn to write crisp descriptions of significant potential future events. Material on systems dynamics and the unintended consequences of future events is included.",

    "description": "What does “designing experience” mean? It is an act of choreographing a series of events in another person’s mind. How is it different from, for example, making a movie? In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and “spoon-fed” to the audience (at least, on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product’s functionality/experience. Here, the user’s experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This class explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, the class redesigns an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, the class designs a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality. Students are encouraged to explore new vocabulary of interactivity, to expand the lexicon of interactive experience, and to examine the societal role of designing experience.",

Students study these and other themes, including how the production of information impacts democratic living and whether individuals should own the information they produce. Students are encouraged to explore conceptual tools, such as cybernetics, as a means of understanding the relationship between interactive telecommunications, information, and democracy, and the legal, social, and economic effects of these interrelationships.",

In order to answer this question, we explore the many modes of storytelling that have been available to artists and writers cross-culturally from epic poetry, the novel, and fables to modernist literature, telegraphy, cinema, and the Internet. Of particular interest is situating narrative structures within their historical and cultural contexts (for instance, the Bible in relation to early Judeo-Christian culture; the rise of the novel in relation to 18th- and 19th-century European social history; narrative cinema in relation to 20th-century American culture; science fiction in relation to the development of 20th-century popular science and technology). After a consideration of such texts as Homer's Iliad, selections from Greek and African mythology, and the Bible, students read various 19th- and 20th century classical and experimental novels and study narrative theory in literature and film. They then consider the nature of digital storytelling in print and on the Web as well as in artist Matthew Barney's Cremaster epic. Extensive reading, in-class presentations, and a final research paper are required.",

It attempts to reveal the tools and ideology necessary to become literate and creative in the overwhelming network of images. Our knowledge of self and the world is increasingly rooted in images. Images are no longer alone; they function as a system, one detonating another and constituting structure and a vocabulary. We study the grammar, knowledge, manipulation, and effects of images in our consciousness and in the culture. Images dominate the print press, the cinema, television, and now the Internet The Internet is the new book, the new illustrated Gutenberg turning point. It is a surprising way of seeing, understanding, and manipulating images, emotion, information and meaning. We study the nonlinear access to and sequence of images on the computer and on the Web; the perception of the bright screen in contrast to the dull page; the multiple icons and the friezes of the different operating systems. We decode the multiple items on the frame and columns of the screen; the intertextual depth achieved by clicking, the palimpsest of screen on screen; the strips of color and the line drawings. We also attempt to discover the laws the Net, such as the flight to cyberspace and the need for gravitas, and use of emoticons being an example the weight of and lust for materiality. We begin by studying the laws of visual perception, then continue by presenting a brief art history of the image. Example: the representation of food from Roman art and still lifes to the advertising of produce and the glossy images of Gourmet and Bon Appetit. This course is as much a workshop as a seminar. Each student, in his or her own medium, chooses, associates, lays out, and designs images and presents the project to the other participants. This is the main work for the course.

Effects: social and psychological fragmentation, gender uncertainty, the backlash of testosterone, the demise of the traditional elites, the smoke and mirrors of entertainment as our new reality, multiple careers, and risk as pleasure. We study how these changes have affected and pervaded our daily lives, from sex, money, and the arts to jobs, religion, and fashion. Because the world has changed so radically, theory is always kept close to facts and feelings, and therefore each topic is grounded in existential instances.

    "description": "Thanks to the graphic user interface, many people have begun to think about \"information spaces\" for the first time. But this is not a new concept; we have been using the everyday environment as an information interface for as long as we have been making tools. We use everyday objects to represent abstract information (that is, information not directly related to the objects) on a routine basis. With the invention of embedded microprocessors, we are now able to automate this process. In this course, we leave the screen behind to focus on our everyday environment as interface, and we look at ways of incorporating telecommunications networks as part of environmental information display. We ask questions such as: How can we use that environment to display information? How can we use movement and sound and space to convey information? How do we analyze an environmental system in terms of its ability to convey information? How do we research, plan, and implement systems for using the everyday environment as information interface? How can we combine the environment-as-interface with the Internet? Students are expected to analyze existing environments in terms of what abstract information they convey; research and describe a solution to a given environmental information problem; and design and develop prototypes of devices that use the everyday environment to convey information.",

    "description": "What does \"designing experience\" mean? It is an act of choreographing a series of events in another person's mind. How is it different from, for example, making a movie? In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and \"spoon-fed\" to the audience (at least, on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product's functionality/experience. Here, the user's experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This class explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, the class redesigns an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, the class designs a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality. Students are encouraged to explore new vocabulary of interactivity, to expand the lexicon of interactive experience, and to examine the societal role of designing experience.",

Formulating creative projects that engage with this research-critically as well as propositionally- is the underlying aim of the workshop. The semester is divided in three sections. The first sections begins with an assignment to create alternative representations of the world map. Data and statistics about the world as a whole are collected, and through analytical digital representations, new forms of imagining the world map are considered. Examples of mapping strategies and information visualization techniques are analyzed. In the second section, students zoom into the world map and select specific regions to study the impact of new technologies on the social, cultural, and political realms. For example, \"tech-regions\" such as Silicon Valley, San Jose, Bangalore (India), Dublin (Ireland), or Malayasia's multimedia super corridor may pose interesting case studies. In addition to regions, student may also select NGOs, nonprofit organizations, or multinational corporations working internationally. The last section concentrates on final projects that should include conceptualizing and producing an interface, an installation, or an application for one of the following three contexts: United Nations Visitors' Center, world history exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History, or Documenta XI (an art exhibit in Kassel, Germany). A class site visit to the United Nations and the American Museum of Natural History is planned.",

This course covers the design and implementation of the \"dynamic\" Web site in two distinct but related contexts: the technical aspects of manipulating content \"on the fly\" and the end-user experience of interacting in this type of setting. Particular attention is given to social and community-based Web interaction. The production environment consists of the MySQL database and the Perl programming language. Students develop a firm knowledge of database design and optimization, the SQL query language, and the use of Perl to create dynamic activity of both orthodox and unorthodox nature. Late-semester topics focus on interfacing this environment with other technologies such as JavaScript, Flash, Shockwave, Director, and XML. Class requirements include homework assignments to reinforce each week's concepts while simultaneously contributing to the student's \"tool-kit\" of code and design principles. There is also a midterm project and a final project of the student's choosing. Given the wide range of applications that would benefit from a Web-accessible database, students may use their project(s) from this class to support or enhance projects from other classes.",

These most likely center on the telecommunications infrastructure, although they may also (at the students' discretion) include the global economy, international politics, environmental concerns, or other large-scale issues. Scenario planning is a rigorous but exciting technique, in which people share information and judgment to create a picture of the future larger than any individual could produce alone. The technique has been used for two decades to distinguish certainties from uncertainties and thus develop descriptions of the future that help put present-day decisions into context. The process of generating scenarios is more interesting than the ultimate written descriptions; however, students learn to write crisp descriptions of significant potential future events. Material on systems dynamics and the unintended consequences of future events is included.",

This course analyzes how in various technical, legal, and political ways, privacy is incapacitated and lost. Students explore new approaches to thinking about what privacy is and what information autonomy means. Privacy is analyzed in terms of existing policies of restraint in contrast to the next generation of embedded privacy. This includes notions such as embedding information autonomy via physical computing architecture and building privacy parameters into the cyborg imaginary.

In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and \"spoon-fed\" to the audience (at least on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product's functionality/experience. Here, the user's experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. The class explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, the class redesigns an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, the class designs a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality. Students are encouraged to explore new vocabulary of interactivity, to expand lexicon of interactive experience, and to examine the societal role of designing experience.",

For many of these projects, interactive solutions have developed only after an initial (linear) work was already completed In this sense new media artists have been asked to consider interactivity only as an afterthought. This class seeks to bring interactive development to the forefront of the creative documentary process. Students first work to understand the nature of documentary production such that interactive solutions may be developed at the beginning and continue throughout the process. This course also examines what types of documentaries may be developed when new media and interactivity are kept in mind from the beginning Students consider the nature of basic documentary production from concept to research, fact gathering, interviews, and storytelling. This overview is the starting point from which students develop their own concepts for creating interactive documentaries. Various existing documentary projects are studied in terms of their process and to examine their attempts to utilize interactive technology. Students engage in the process of developing documentary content and creating an interactive experience with the material gathered, emphasizing new project creation rather than retrofitting solutions.

Now, in venues such as weblogs, online conferences, games, and interactive media, writing is part of a larger practice of communication. In this mix, the craft of writing often gets shortchanged or overlooked. Yet elegance and clarity of language are probably the most effective ways to make a piece of work resonate in the mind, and in the blood, of another person. This is a course on the use of elegant writing to make electronic work more powerful. The course covers not just the art and practice of putting one word or sentence in front of another, but also the more difficult challenges of listening to the world, figuring out what we have to say, and laying out the complexities of our thinking in a linear form that others can appreciate. Small assignments build to larger assignments; later assignments dovetail with projects for other courses or purposes.

Social software-software used for group communications, from mailing lists and \"IRC to Everquest and Groove-also has social weather, but it is much harder to read. The culture and behavior of online groups is not as readily apparent as it is in a real room, for several reasons, including limited interfaces, separation of the participants in space and time, and lack of contextual clues. Social Weather examines how we read the mood and feeling of online spaces and the ways software affects the social weather (and vice versa).

The first section begins with an assignment to create alternative representations of the world map. Data and statistics about the world as a whole are collected, and through analytical digital representations, new forms of imagining the world map are considered. Examples of mapping strategies and information visualization techniques are analyzed. In the second section, students zoom into the world map and select specific regions to study the impact of new technologies on the social, cultural, and political realms. For example, \"tech-regions\" such as Silicon Valley San Jose, Bangalore (India), Dublin (Ireland), or Malaysia's multimedia super corridor may pose interesting case studies.

Information Contours explores the nature of the information flows that are generated by evolving and ever-innovating information technology (IT). Are digital media and network connections the most democratic of media, or are they circumscribed by gatekeepers\" and \"walled gardens\"? How can we intelligently analyze the relationship between information and communication technologies and people? What is “intellectual property,” and what role does copyright and patent protection play in expanding or constricting accessible information? IT now suggests the contours that information assumes are the lifeblood of democracy. Yet information, this assumed basic ingredient of democracy, is increasingly produced, manufactured, privatized, and marketed as a commodity. What of this? And where are the markers describing and contrasting the public's interest in information with, for example, copyright laws that now summon you to a courthouse for unauthorized sharing? The free flow of information has been undermined by the increasing application and expansion of copyright and patent law to further the privatization commodification, and control of information. Yet original and open cultural expression requires democratic access to information sources and the means of information production and dissemination. As IT-computers, telephony, bioengineering software, Internet, etc.- increases the quantity of, and applications for, information in society, cultural, social, economic, political, legal, and ethical ramifications multiply. In countless ways, large and small, public and private, IT is both harnessed to achieve specific goals and, by virtue of its existence, shapes the way culture is informed. Through the power of IT, information succeeds as an autonomous aggrandizing value. Does this indicate a fundamental change for society? As IT becomes more ubiquitous and embedded in culture, transformative issues arise as to its applicability, extension, and direction. Civil society is experiencing a shift in the value of information including its nomenclature, applications, and normative function. Progress in IT increasingly focuses our attention on the way in which information influences culture and thereby informs contemporary democracy. What is the relation between information flows, culture, economics, government, and democracy? How are we going to govern/direct all of this technology? Is there really a form of culture here-cyberspace-that we have not known before and that will require new forms of control? Or is cyberspace an electronic version of ordinary space where traditional forms of governing will suffice? Information Contours explores all of this and more.",

    "description": "Probably the most significant trend of the past decade in digital audio has been the gradual shift away from the dedicated hardware synthesizer to the \"soft\" synthesizer, that is, a synthesizer that is simply a programming environment on a general-purpose computer. With the increase in CPU speed and disk capacity, such soft synths are becoming more powerful and flexible. This course serves as an introduction to new tools that allow one to repurpose the computer to be a soft synth. The main focus is on Cycling 74's Max/MSP software, as well as its video component Jitter. Students learn to use the tool to manipulate synthesizers (both hard and soft), generate and manipulate audio signals and alter live audio and video, and much more. The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) specification is also explored as a control system both generally and from within the Max environment. Exploration of synth methods in a typical MIDI device leads in turn to DSP techniques including FM, additive synthesis, granular synthesis, waveshaping, and physical modeling. Video is treated as an extension to the sonic palette, and integration is sought between visual and aural creations. Portability is stressed, and students are encouraged to work with their own tools as appropriate.",

There is a growing tension between the economic needs of digital commerce and expectations of privacy as articulated by privacy advocates. What is \"privacy\"? This course traces and questions whether the historical notion of privacy is adequate to champion individual autonomy in an interactive digital age. The course examines how privacy is increasingly encompassed by information technology. Various computing applications have been proposed, and in some cases implemented, that have the potential of being invasive of privacy such as RFID and the successors to governmental programs such as Total Information Awareness. Is it possible to address privacy concerns with intelligent design of core technologies? What are the privacy issues connected with biometrics, smart cards, data-mining, and pattern analysis? Is privacy an effective or adequate notion for protecting personal information? This course analyzes how in various technical, legal, and political ways, privacy is incapacitated and lost. The course offers new approaches to thinking about what privacy is and what information autonomy means. Privacy is analyzed in terms of existing policies of restraint in contrast to the next generation of embedded privacy. This includes notions such as embedding information autonomy via computing architecture and building privacy parameters into the cyborg imaginary. This course lends itself to one of ITP's great assets: creativity. Students develop a conceptual understanding of privacy as an identity platform upon which can be embedded the architecture of digital autonomy.",

In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and \"spoon-fed' to the audience (at least on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product's functionality/experience. Here, the user's experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This course explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, students redesign an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, they design a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality.

Now, in venues such as weblogs, online conferences, games, and interactive media, writing is part of a larger practice of communication. In this mix, the craft of writing often gets shortchanged or overlooked. Yet elegance and clarity of language are probably the most effective ways to make a piece of work resonate in the mind, and in the blood, of another person. This is a course on the use of elegant writing to make electronic work more powerful. The course covers not just the art and practice of putting one word or sentence in front of another, but also the more difficult challenges of listening to the world, figuring out what we have to say, and laying out the complexities of our thinking in a linear form that others can appreciate. Small assignments build to larger assignments; later assignments dovetail with projects for other courses or purposes. Students learn to interview effectively, to edit each other's work, to see their work as a naive reader would see it, to cut to size, to write promotional content that does not make readers want to gag, and to distinguish good writing from mediocre writing-particularly in the context of the new requirements of the Internet and Web audiences.

Similarly, this is not a course in academic writing; it is a course in creating words that people will want to read for pleasure and informal learning. The course embraces fiction, nonfiction, and their increasingly important hybrids.",

For longer than we might imagine, cultural theorists have foreseen these shifts, feared them, fought for them, celebrated them, and, clearly, misunderstood them. This seminar explores the thread of interactivity in cultural media as well as the opportunities and perils posed by the associated rise of mass interpretation, authorship, and bottom-up organization. The course traces the interactive imperative, from animated cave paintings and the alphabet to cut-and-paste novels and open source programming. Students encounter literary perspectives from Walter Benjamin to William Burroughs, media theory from Walter Ong to Baudrillard, social critique from Spinoza to Adorno, cultural programming from Genesis P-Orridge to Donna Harraway, and play theory from Huizinga to Howard Rheingold, all in the context of the relationship of interactivity to autonomy and agency. The course also covers the ideas and intentions of some of networking technology's pioneers, from Vannevar Bush to Norbert Weiner. Students are required to read approximately one book per week, lead one class discussion, supplement one class discussion with audiovisual resources, and write two short papers arguing a cogent theoretical perspective on new media.",

This integration of problem solving and creative inspiration in the hands of talented people is a very powerful tool. Victor Papenek, author of Design for the Real World, says industrial design is “the most dangerous profession there is.” This accelerated course surveys the range of issues and knowledge a good industrial designer commands. Students are introduced to the skills and crafts designers use to create and present their ideas. Students learn the classic phases of the industrial design process: (1) analysis, (2) exploration and synthesis (3) development, (4) refinement, and (5) manufacturing. These phases are good for planning projects, scheduling work, and reassuring clients. The course also discusses materials and manufacturing processes that are used to actually produce real things. The course also includes getting dirty designing and making things.

Giving your idea over to users from the very beginning can improve both the quality of your application and the speed at which it develops. To that end, the course familiarizes students with rapid prototyping techniques rather than following a more traditional semester-long design process, and it is best suited to students seeking experience examining live usage of their concepts. Students form teams to design and launch a prototype built for a small core group of people they personally care about, who collectively approve and participate in each project at every stage. The core group may include both classmates and outside participants who already know each other and the creator(s) well enough to be invested in, and help to determine the direction of, the application. At the rapid design stage students are encouraged to restate flaws as features, promote self-interest and obscure topics, put forward solutions in search of problems, force concepts onto seemingly unsuitable technologies, all with the goal of putting something out to be used as quickly as possible by the core group. By the midterm, team projects are expected to be already in use and ready to be deployed. Teams continue to collect feedback from the core group and iterate while the project is live. As the project scope expands, teams spend the second half of the course studying the social effects of changing audiences, applying techniques to study usage rates and \"stickiness,\" acquiring user feedback automatically, and directing users to newly added features. Teams open the prototypes up to new users, identify and circumvent flaws, add user customization and recruitment tools, and may even combine or adapt features from other teams. The prototypes require some server components and may be built in a wide variety of technologies, including HTML, Processing, and Flash.",

If you were to turn to a fellow student and say, “I do” or “I sentence you to five years in prison,” your listener would not become your spouse or be hustled off to Rikers. Nothing happens during a wedding or a sentencing hearing; those events are just special forms of talking. Yet talking, in those circumstances, creates real change in the world. There are two nested effects here-the inner one is the conditions under which speech becomes action, and the outer one is the ways we give groups the power to enforce those actions. Social software creates novel contexts for groups, but currently operates outside traditional social support for group action. For example, both corporations and online groups can have high degrees of internal cohesion and strive for external effects on the world but corporations have the blessing of society, as an official \"legal fiction,\" to take actions that ordinary groups, no matter how cohesive, are forbidden to take. That gap is mainly one of tradition-one can readily imagine alternate \"legal fictions\" to support alternate kinds of groups. This course is centered around weekly readings and class discussions of primary materials, some historical, some current, revolving around four questions: What effect does social software have on groups who want to take action in the world? How do groups come to binding decisions about the action they want to take? What are the traditional supports and constraints for real-world groups (corporations, governments, NGOs, etc.) that act on the world? And what new forms of social support can we imagine for groups that are mainly or solely organized online? The course features readings from political and economic theory of group action, the social structure of engaged (as opposed to merely conversational) groups, and field observations of real-world groups using social software. Students are expected to keep a weekly journal, to write midterm and final papers on groups trying to use social software to effect real change in the world. Note: This course is politically neutral.

Reading social weather is a basic human skill. Social software-software used for group communications also has social weather, but it is much harder to read. The culture and behavior of online groups is not as readily apparent as it is in a real room, for several reasons, including limited interfaces, separation of the participants in space and time, and lack of contextual clues. Social Weather examines how we read the mood and feeling of online spaces and the ways software affects the social weather (and vice versa).

Information Contours explores the nature of the information flows that are generated by evolving and ever-innovating information technology (IT). Are digital media and network connections the most democratic of media, or are they circumscribed by \"gatekeepers\" and \"walled gardens\"? How can we intelligently analyze the relationship between information and communication technologies and people? What is \"intellectual property,\" and what role does copyright and patent protection play in expanding or constricting accessible information? IT now suggests the contours that information assumes are the lifeblood of democracy. Yet information, this assumed basic ingredient of democracy, is increasingly produced, manufactured, privatized, and marketed as a commodity. What of this? And where are the markers describing and contrasting the public's interest in information with, for example, copyright laws that now summon you to a courthouse for unauthorized sharing? The free flow of information has been undermined by the increasing application and expansion of copyright and patent law to further the privatization, commoditization, and control of information. Yet original and open cultural expression requires democratic access to information sources and the means of information production and dissemination. As IT-computers, telephony, bioengineering, software, Internet, increases the quantity of, and applications for, information in society, cultural, social, economic, political, legal, and ethical ramifications multiply. In countless ways, large and small, public and private, IT is both harnessed to achieve specific goals and, by virtue of its existence, shapes the way culture is informed. Through the power of IT, information succeeds as an autonomous aggrandizing value. Does this indicate a fundamental change for society? As IT becomes more ubiquitous and embedded in culture, transformative issues arise as to its applicability, extension, and direction. Civil society is experiencing a shift in the value of information including its nomenclature, applications, and normative function. Progress in IT increasingly focuses our attention on the way in which information influences culture and thereby informs contemporary democracy. What is the relation between information flows, culture, economics, government, and democracy? How are we going to govern/direct all of this technology? Is there really a form of culture here-cyberspace-that we have not known before and that will require new forms of control? Or is cyberspace an electronic version of ordinary space where traditional forms of governing will suffice? Information Contours explores all of this and more.",

The focus is on the opportunities and responsibilities designers take on when creating interactive experiences for the general public. The course follows a rigorous methodology and requires students to work on their fundamental design presentation skills. Students work in small teams to evolve their ideas from concept through design documentation to proof-of-concept. Each team presents a working prototype of an interactive media system for a public space at the end of the semester. Throughout the course, students learn basic project management skills that aid in the realization of innovative ideas. Weekly discussions briefly cover topical subjects such as tangible user interfaces, alternative feedback devices, wireless computing environments, and hybrid interactive systems that tie physical spaces to the Internet. The final project includes the presentation of the project with all supporting design documentation (written concept summary, flowcharts, storyboards, and scripts) and project presentation board. The prototype and all ancillary materials are presented in the end-of-semester show.",

    "description": "Networks exist in the spaces between things; they require both concrete entities (computers, people, businesses) and abstract relations (protocols, friendships, contracts). We understand intuitively that networked computers differ from stand-alone computers, or that a group of friends differs from an aggregation of anonymous individuals, but describing that difference clearly is difficult. In particular, networks exhibit emergent characteristics that cannot be explained simply by examining their constituent parts. People are not like computers, but networks of people and networks of computers are alike in many ways. It is the organization of the respective networks that creates those similarities. Network Effects is a course about the structure of networks and how that structure affects human experience. We focus in particular on two invisible networks-communications networks and social networks. Communications networks are invisible in the traditional sense; their inner workings are hidden from us. We examine a variety of communications networks and explore the ways different networks affect the experiences of their users. Social networks are invisible in a different way; because we are so immersed in myriad social networks-friends, family, work, school don't see them. We examine some of the structural elements of social networks, such as strong and weak ties, clustering, and small-worlds networks, to understand some of the ways that the shape of social networks affects us. The goal of the course is to synthesize observations about these two types of networks. Technological choices embodied in electronic networks profoundly affect their social dimensions: Why can we CC people on email but not on phone calls? How does the one-way network of television differ from the two-way network of the Internet? What effect does BitTorrent's architectural decentralization have on its users? Social choices also affect the design of technology; resistance to spamming or attempts to hide from the RIAA have led to several deep technological changes in the design of Weblogs and file-sharing networks, respectively, changes that alter the social relations among the users. The class meetings center on discussion of readings and lectures. Outside class, students complete two short papers, a midterm project, and a final paper or project. The midterm project involves designing and implementing a small network (though not necessarily a computer-mediated one) and describing its effects. The final is a project or research interest of the student's choice and involves designing, building, and describing a network; a visual and descriptive analysis of an existing network; or a research paper.",

There is a growing tension between the economic needs of digital commerce and expectations of privacy as articulated by privacy advocates. What is “privacy”? This course traces and questions whether the historical notion of privacy is adequate to champion individual autonomy in an interactive digital age. The course examines how privacy is increasingly encompassed by information technology. Various computing applications have been proposed, and in some cases implemented, that have the potential of being invasive of privacy such as RFID and the successors to governmental programs such as Total Information Awareness. Is it possible to address privacy concerns with intelligent design of core technologies? What are the privacy issues connected with biometrics, smart cards, data-mining, and pattern analysis? Is privacy an effective or adequate notion for protecting personal information? This course analyzes how in various technical, legal, and political ways, privacy is incapacitated and lost. The course offers new approaches to thinking about what privacy is and what information autonomy means. Privacy is analyzed in terms of existing policies of restraint in contrast to the next generation of embedded privacy. This includes notions such as embedding information autonomy via computing architecture and building privacy parameters into the cyborg imaginary. This course lends itself to one of ITP's great assets: creativity. Students develop a conceptual understanding of privacy as an identity platform upon which can be embedded the architecture of digital autonomy.",

Along the way, they learn techniques for making synchronous TCP and UDP, connections, formatting, compressing and parsing data, client/server and peer to peer architectures, connecting with physical computing devices, and real-time analysis and synthesis of video images. Another goal of this course is for students to learn to program using Java. Java basics are covered \"as needed\" for the specific networking techniques covered.

In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and \"spoon-fed\" to the audience (at least on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product's functionality/experience. Here, the user's experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This course explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, students redesign an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, they design a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality. Students are encouraged to explore new vocabulary of interactivity, to expand lexicon of interactive exper1ence, and to examine the societal role of designing experience.",

Programming languages are inherently ever-changing and often require new syntax and structures to be learned. Does this perpetual learning curve stifle our creative process? Or, in contrast, can the abundance of technical know-how cloud a simple vision? Considering these issues, students identify and improve the way they work with technology and particularly software design. The first session covers foundation concepts and techniques in visual computational media (principles of producing color, shape, composition, and motion), interaction/usability principles (GUI/UI, gesture mapping, locus of attention, affordance), sound design for interactive systems (live input analysis, multiple-samples management, synthesis), and overall project design (Colonel John Boyd's OODA loop). With this knowledge at hand, we observe how third-party software affects our work and in response we construct our own software tools. Students then use their tools to build toward a final project and provide an account of personal observations (for example, how much time was spent building the tools versus observing/practicing/using them, and how does this reflect on the final quality of the product). The course is delivered using Processing, but other platforms are welcomed and encouraged. The nature of the assignments is minimalist and simple, so you may use the course as a primer to programming, or just take a step back and reexamine how technology relates to your creative process. In both cases, a better understanding of the craft is within reach.",

Now, in venues such as weblogs, online conferences, games, and interactive media, writing is part of a larger practice of communication. In this mix, the craft of writing often gets shortchanged or overlooked. Yet elegance and clarity of language are probably the most effective ways to make a piece of work resonate in the mind, and in the blood, of another person. This is a course on the use of elegant writing to make electronic work more powerful. The course covers not just the art and practice of putting one word or sentence in front of another, but also the more difficult challenges of listening to the world, figuring out what we have to say, and laying out the complexities of our thinking in a linear form that others can appreciate. Small assignments build to larger assignments; later assignments dovetail with projects for other courses or purposes. Students learn to interview effectively, to edit each other's work, to see their work as a naive reader would see it, to cut to size, to write promotional content that does not make readers want to gag, and to distinguish good writing from mediocre writing-particularly in the context of the new requirements of the Internet and Web audiences.

Whether these games are measured in terms of number of players, geographical dimensions, or temporal scope, they represent a new trend in which the \"little world\" created by a game threatens to swallow up the \"real world\" in which it is situated. This course is a hands-on workshop that is focused on the particular design problems of large-scale games. Students develop a foundation of basic game design understanding from which to approach the specific issues particular to big games; analyze existing digital and nondigital large-scale games, taking them apart to understand how they work as interactive systems; and work on a series of design exercises that explore the social, technological, and creative possibilities of large-scale games.",

We learn alternative and low-cost methods of developing circuit boards. In this way, students explore systems by examining the components and repurposing them for a new system that they designed. This includes using elements from existing appliances and constructing one's own homemade circuit boards. The focus is on cost-effective methods of construction. On a larger scale, the course also considers how entire systems may be repurposed with little modification to the original system. This may include looking into the workings of common appliances. The course examines both the hardware and the software sides of recycling technology. Students also look at \"throwaway culture”-and the surrounding issues of ethics, impacts, and alternative solutions for discarded technology (currently only 2 percent of consumers will hold onto a particular device for five years or more). Students are asked, \"What can we recycle from this throwaway technology and what should we do with what cannot be reused?\" This deconstructionist approach to physical computing includes taking an appliance apart, then creating components from the ground up as part of the new system. By co-opting the components of other systems and combining them with our own, the students have the opportunity to explore the makeup of a system, create a new one, and provide commentary about technology in today's culture.

    "description": "If you were inventing a museum today, what would it look like? Who would be there? What would its main purpose be? Before you answer that question, let's take a look back. The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside-amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go. The public was very limited; children were usually not allowed in. They were elitist institutions whose mission was archiving the past. Today, although most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors, there are fundamental ways-attitudes, techniques, structural issues-that are still lodged in the 19th century. Now, because of a very different kind of Cabinet of Wonder, i.e., the computer and other IT technologies, museums are able to display collections, demonstrate concepts, and reach their audiences in new ways. Most have not taken full advantage of these new tools or had the time to explore how they might change the nature of a museum visit, but we do in this course. We document together the ways in which technology may enhance the museum experience. We evaluate the use of interactive technologies in museums and how that experience might be extended online. But first we observe and study what they do now. We cannot invent a new wheel before we understand the old one. In this course, we explore the different kinds of exhibits in museums (object-based collection, demonstrations of phenomena), historic or single topic museums (e.g., the Tenement Museum), and the varied kinds of venues for exhibits (museums, trade shows, traveling, nature centers). Students learn through experience and discussion a brief history of museums and exhibitions and discover criteria for informal learning environments that differ from schoolroom learning. This course is an exploration, observation, and theory course. You are asked to visit specific museums: an iconic one of each type. These visits are your primary assignments-sometimes accompanied by a reading. A guest speaker from the assigned museum makes an in-class presentation and receives critiques from we you. In the second half of the course, we begin to reinvent the museum. What is its purpose in the 21st century? How does the need for a curator change? We look at different museums' efforts to use technology to take museums beyond the walls, to expand the notion of curators, to include people who don't have access, or don't know they do, to the places. And though we focus on museums, we also look at exhibits and other public displays of information. This is not a design or production course. The assignments are field trips to museums, readings, and writing. The course is primarily discussion-based, and class participation is a major part of the grade.",

Giving your idea over to users from the very beginning can improve both the quality of your application and the speed at which it develops. To that end, the course familiarizes students with rapid prototyping techniques rather than following a more traditional semester-long design process, and it is best suited to students seeking experience examining live usage of their concepts. Students form teams to design and launch a prototype built for a small core group of people they personally care about, who collectively approve and participate in each project at every stage. The core group may include both classmates and outside participants who already know each other and the creator(s) well enough to be invested in, and help to determine the direction of, the application. At the rapid design stage students are encouraged to restate flaws as features, promote self-interest and obscure topics, put forward solutions in search of problems, force concepts onto seemingly unsuitable technologies, all with the goal of putting something out to be used as quickly as possible by the core group. By the midterm, team projects are expected to be already in use and ready to be deployed. Teams continue to collect feedback from the core group and iterate while the project is live. As the project scope expands, teams spend the second half of the course studying the social effects of changing audiences, applying techniques to study usage rates and \"stickiness,\" acquiring user feedback automatically, and directing users to newly added features. Teams open the prototypes up to new users, identify and circumvent flaws, add user customization and recruitment tools, and may even combine or adapt features from other teams.

If you were to turn to a fellow student and say, \"I do\" or \"I sentence you to five years in prison,\" your listener would not become your spouse or be hustled off to Rikers. Nothing happens during a wedding or a sentencing hearing; those events are just special forms of talking. Yet talking, in those circumstances, creates real change in the world. There are two nested effects here-the inner one is the conditions under which speech becomes action, and the outer one is the ways we give groups the power to enforce those actions. Social software creates novel contexts for groups, but currently operates outside traditional social support for group action. For example, both corporations and online groups can have high degrees of internal cohesion and strive for external effects on the world, but corporations have the blessing of society, as an official \"legal fiction,\" to take actions that ordinary groups, no matter how cohesive, are forbidden to take. That gap is mainly one of tradition-one can readily imagine alternate \"legal fictions\" to support alternate kinds of groups. This course is centered around weekly readings and class discussions of primary materials, some historical, some current, revolving around four questions: What effect does social software have on groups who want to take action in the world? How do groups come to binding decisions about the action they want to take? What are the traditional supports and constraints for real-world groups (corporations, governments, NGOs, etc.) that act on the world? And what new forms of social support can we imagine for groups that are mainly or solely organized online? The course features readings from political and economic theory of group action, the social structure of engaged (as opposed to merely conversational) groups, and field observations of realworld groups using social software. Students are expected to keep a weekly journal, to write midterm and final papers on groups trying to use social software to effect real change in the world. Note: This course is politically neutral.

That future, maybe, is not that far off-the city of London itself has half-a-million cameras installed for use by the security services. How can one remain in control of one's identity in that future? This course creates a framework to help students not only analyze existing technology, but also to help them think more deeply about their own projects. Students review current technologies such as Internet protocols, cellular networks, and RFID; they also get hands-on experience in both using these technologies and hacking them. We all understand why you shouldn't throw out a credit card receipt with the card's number on it without tearing it up, but should we be concerned with clicking on a link on a Web page? Sending an instant message? Opening a laptop to sign onto the wireless network at Starbucks? Maybe. Clicking on a Web page records your IP address on a Web server somewhere, instant messages are usually sent off unencrypted over the network, and opening a laptop usually requires negotiation with a DHCP server that records your computer's unique identifier. Our devices and our online interactions leave a mark as unique as our fingerprints; thus, relevant questions are how can we turn those tables? What technologies can we create to trace information left by others? Given that openness is a core feature of the networks and technologies we use, what code, regulations, and etiquette make these usable? Weekly classes and assignments are balanced between background survey reading, technical reading, and hands-on experience all culminating in a final project.",

    "description": "Living art combines physical computing and generative art techniques, providing an environment for students interested in pursuing an artistic outlet for their physical computing skills. Generative art creates a process of evolution. Where most art imitates life, generative art has a life of its own. Generative methods have been chained to the personal computer for too long. The course asks the question, what would happen if we took the algorithms employed in software art and applied them to the physical world through sensors and reactive elements? Or, as in Ned Kahn's piece \"Wind,\" what if we were to apply laws of nature to physical works? In this class we apply simple rules to dictate the shape or function of a work, and add to it an inherent complexity that is both beautiful and intelligent. By combining a set of simple rules, or a system, with physical computing, we marry the work to the intention of the artist. This helps us define what we are doing when we create and allows us to take the assignments beyond exercises in executing basic electronics. Living art extracts the generative approach from the personal computer and applies it to the physical world. In some cases it is very clear how we can apply generative methods in the use of motors or light grids, but how might we apply fuzzy logic, for example? This class is for students who have completed Introduction to Physical Computing.",

As a sensor the video camera is appealing, delivering up to 36 million bytes every second compared to maybe three bytes from a keyboard. Accessories and knowledge for using cameras are mainstream. For instance, by simply changing lenses the same sensor once used for your fingers can now be aimed at a city block. Even very inexpensive computers are now fast enough to not only record frames of video but also to look through the individual pixels. It is no wonder cameras have become a standard accessory for computers (especially in cell phones). The difficulty of computer vision comes when you expect your software to be able to mimic the powers of the human brain to interpret arbitrary images. This course attempts to sidestep the difficult parts if you are willing to work in fairly contrived environments such as art installations, eye tracking rigs, or ant farms. The course covers software techniques for tracking objects in video, background removal, blob detection, as well as tricks on the optical side of the equation. Video tracking in real time requires a coding parsimony that can be used as a challenging method to improve a student's overall coding skills. The course uses Java in the Eclipse environment, which is a good next step from the Processing environment. We look at implementing these techniques across platforms, including the desktop, the cell phone, and even on a microcontroller.

Students work through a series of discrete design exercises covering basic concepts such as affordance, feedback and modality. These exercises cover different types of interactive experiences, from simple, appliance-like design problems to dense information systems. Students gain a hands-on understanding of how to combine physical controls and screen-based design elements to support different types of interactions. In the second section, students acquire the tools and methods to conduct primary research with end-users, deriving relevant insights from direct observational research to shape their design solutions. In the final section, we look at some of the prevailing models for interactive systems, drawing from gaming, Web 2.0, and pervasive computing.

The use of motion capture has increased in popularity, due to recent technological advances, and due to increased demand in entertainment, computer animation, visual input for new human-computer-interfaces, and scientific applications. Students discover how to use motion capture for computer animation and all the enthusiasm that it currently sparks. The course introduces students to the use of state-of-the-art, marker- and vision-based motion capture setups, working with dancers. As part of an effort to explore and understand motion from an artistic and from a scientific point of view, Chris Bregler (http://movement.nyu.edu) and Jean-Marc Gauthier (www.tinkering.net) introduce students to the exciting and sometimes controversial art of capturing and re-creating motion of living creatures. We look at designing motion and the ability to create the illusion of life as applied to the expressions and the styles of a person or character. Students gain hands-on experience with a motion capture setup that can measure full-body movements from dancers (for example, the Pilobolus Dance Company), facial expressions from actors, or motions of animals. Students also explore the history of motion with recordings going back to Marey and Muybridge in the late 19th century and early applications of rotoscoping dating back to animated features like Disney's Snow White. Special emphasis is placed on creating interactive storytelling involving interactive character animation using Alias Maya, Alias MotionBuilder, and Virtools.

Many unconscious cues and actions that are valued in ordinary human expression are ignored or filtered by computer-mediated interactions. On the one hand, relinquishing a conscious gatekeeper can be associated with such uncomfortable subjects as subliminal manipulation, subconscious repression, even a loss of free will and the insanity defense. On the other hand, going past conscious control can be associated with achieving virtuosity in the arts and athletics, acquiring insight into your personality, and engendering trust in conversation. In this course, students build on software and hardware tool kits to create hands-on experiments tapping less conscious parts of our experience. Initial topics include using a cell phone as personal sensor logger and visualizing the results; capturing subtle body language (e.g., eye-tracking) and transmitting it over a network; triggering and detecting subconscious activity (e.g., EEG); and the transition from communication to expression. Throughout the course, we relate these techniques to the advantages of introducing computers at all such as search, storage, and transmission.

Interactivity, the passage of time, and resolution are just a few of the ideas that are being explored. Yet these ideas are new only in the sense that they are being adapted to new media. For example, in painting and sculpture, Renaissance and baroque artists used a variety of means to actively engage the viewer; the concept of continuous narrative, reaching back to the Egyptians, aims to convey the passage of time; and the notion of resolution has been variously interpreted by Titian, Seurat, Cezanne, de Kooning, Close, and many others. This course examines how artists throughout history have utilized various media and techniques to effect formal, conceptual, and experiential dynamics comparable to those being investigated by new media is artists today. The goal of the course not only to provide students with knowledge of the immensely rich history of artistic creativity, but also-and more important-to provide a platform through which that knowledge may be utilized to reconsider new media strategies of artistic expression. Through observation, discussion, reading, and projects (both written and hands-on), students acquire mental tools to approach their own work with an expanded understanding of artistic possibility.

What impact do our practices have on the environment, and what changes can we make to lessen the damage we do and increase any positive effects our work has? What skills or ideas do we bring to the table that can have the best effect? What are the most important things for a long-range sustainability program at ITP to focus on? In looking for answers to these questions, we attempt to address both our practice here at ITP and the assumptions we take with us into work and life after ITP. We build an online resource for ourselves and others based on what we learn in the process. This might include reading lists, suggested actions to be taken, links to sources of useful materials and tools for designers and artists, and to organizations whose work overlaps ours. We implement what changes we can and make suggestions on those that will take longer. For several of the class meetings, guest practitioners from a variety of areas join the class to discuss how their work is affected by these issues. The class is broken into groups of four, and each group is expected to research a given guest's work and prepare to lead the class conversation with the guest. Students are expected to read and research widely on the issues addressed in the class, report on their findings, participate actively in discussions in class and online, and to begin to take action in their own practices.",

This workshop aims to bring information sources we all care about into the mainstream. Our goal is to explore how selective streams of information can be sited and expressed in a way that not only creates engagement on the part of the viewer, but inspires action. Students work on a two-part, semester-long design project based on an information source of their choice. Basic programming or action-script skills are required. The course is conducted as a design studio with bimonthly critiques. It includes seminar discussions and guest visits by experts in the design profession. All aspects of visual communication are addressed, with an emphasis on typography, layout, color, and motion. Students need not have any formal design training, but should come with a particular interest in and commitment to honing their design skills.",

    "description": "Internet television\" defines the union of three independent forms: linear video content (such as a television program), the broadband Internet as a distribution mechanism, and interactive devices (such as the PC, mobile phone, PSP, or TiVo) as playback and interaction platforms. While the convergence of these forms has been predicted and expected for several years, 2006 was a watershed year for Internet television with such milestones as the launch of Google Video, the rise of YouTube, and the availability of Lost on iTunes. The potential of Internet television is twofold: (1) to empower viewers to watch what they want to watch when and where they want to experience it and (2) to empower content creators with a rich new medium for which to develop innovative types of entertainment experiences that leverage full motion video, interactivity, and a ubig uitous \"connectivity.\" This course explores the history, current mainstream emergence, and predicted future of several different experience categories that make up the world of Internet television. Categories in focus include the \"two-foot\" PC-based broadband video experience, the \"six-inch\" mobile video experience, and the \"10-foot\" experience of the living room television Internet-enabled set-top box. What opportunities to create new forms of entertainment or communication are enabled by the mainstream emergence of these various flavors of Internet television? This question is approached from two angles: the creative and the practical. On a practical level, the course covers some of the specific technical steps involved in preparing video, designing interfaces, and coding interactivity for a variety of Internet television platforms. During the semester, students are required to pick one of these platforms to research and present to the class in greater depth. On a creative level, students are expected to review and prepare regular critiques of various examples of Internet television content and develop their own creative concepts for Internet television properties to \"pitch\" to the class. The class provides feedback and explores the aesthetics and boundaries of this emerging medium. At the end of the semester, students present a more fully fleshed out proposal for a specific \"concept\" for an Internet television property. The class has periodic drop-in visits from executives in the entertainment, advertising, and consumer electronics industries to provide perspective on the current trends and opportunities for innovation.",

Is there a relationship between creating disorder within a technological system and social disorder? And can this disorder be positive, in the case of \"electronic civil disobedience\"? Presupposing a relationship between computer code and social codes calls into question the larger nature and value of systems and the means by which one might effectively change them. The political, phenomenological, and practical problems raised by this set of issues form the backdrop for this course, in which we survey tactical media works developed since the 1960s, with an emphasis on work since 1995. We look at artists' use of a variety of media-including the news media, the Internet, locative media, surveillance techniques, genetic modification, software viruses, memes, live performance, the audience, and more-to carry out protests. We also visit precursors to tactical media, including that which is typically referred to as \"protest art\" and important media intervention projects. The relationship between the evolution of communication media and the shift in tactics is among our core concerns. We hear from guest lecturers and read a combination of theoretical texts, seminal curatorial statements, manifestos, and mainstream press response to these interventions. An emphasis on media specificity leads to discussions focused on design questions and other practical considerations, with regard to participants' own work.

The structure of the course is dynamic and student-led, with a focus on discussion and analysis. We look at examples of existing games in depth. Students are encouraged to share the game projects they are working on outside the class for feedback and critique. Each session revolves around a specific game design issue or problem. Some of these issues are brought to the class by the instructor and some emerge through discussion and debate. Examples of topics covered include the origin and development of gameplay genres; the true potential of massively multiplayer gameplay; games and interactive narrative; games as rhetoric/persuasive games; the role of the designer in the game development process; and total immersion: gaming's Holy Grail or a naive fallacy?

As a result, JavaScript, once ghettoized, has become the darling of the Web 2.0 world. This course covers a broad selection of technical subjects concerning Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) including advanced JavaScript, DOM manipulation, Google Maps API, XSLT, JSON, RPC, XMLHttpRequest and the various available AJAX frameworks (GWT, Prototype, Dojo, jQuery, etc.) Students are expected to be proficient in at least one other programming language. There are small exercises assigned for each class to ensure that the techniques are understood and mastered. Students are encouraged to either build a small project or to incorporate their new knowledge into projects from other courses such as Dynamic Web Development. In full, the course covers enough information for the student to build their own Google Maps yet retain a conceptual framework that can be applied in designing anything from the next best Web 2.0 service to the most radical net-art happening since Jodi hijacked Netscape.",

    "description": "Whether we design an application for the small touch pad of a cell phone, a game for an elderly user, or produce art through a self-defined conviction, our work is often driven by constraints some chosen, others imposed. With digital technologies, one other constraint is our own ability to keep up with the ever-shifting tools that we use. Does this perpetual learning curve stifle our creative process? Or in contrast, can an abundance of technical know-how cloud a simple vision? The goal of this course is to make work that is fueled by the positive constraints (our audience, our vision) rather then the damaging ones (our lack of ability to know everything about the tools we use). Through weekly assignments, we draw ideas and production techniques from art, game design, music (sound art), cognitive science, and universal design toward an understanding of how to carry our initial ideas through a development process, without compromising quality and clarity of vision. For a final assignment, students are asked to create a project for a specific target audience defined by age/gender/race/culture and ability, The goal is to allow oneself a space for exploration while working toward a focused result. Some ideas for projects may include simplifying an application for the growing elderly population (can grandmama really use that fancy Nokia phone?), a software game based solely on audio (ever played Doom without a monitor in a dark room?), or an art piece that clearly conveys your artistic intentions with a digital medium (think of interactive art that's not utterly frustrating/annoying for gallery goers). In either case, we test our work early and often (starting midsemester), learn to identify problems, and solve them through an iterative design process. When needed, software examples are programmed using Processing. We also use simple pcomp modules to quicken exploration (such as custom keyboard emulators). A fair understanding of ICM and pcomp is required, as you are asked not to spend the majority of your energy learning new technologies, but rather make the best of what you already know. That's one of the course constraints.",

    "description": "Rapid prototyping and personal fabrication increasingly open possibilities of production that will reinvent our understanding and relationship with everyday objects and material culture. The seminar functions as both an introduction to different CNC + prototyping equipment as well as a studio in which to test the possibilities and constraints of these new methods of production. Using 3D printing, laser cutting, and milling, we develop a language of \"making\" that can be brought to bear on two different scales: product and display wall. The seminar works within various scripting and modeling environments as a means to both work with form and translate form into real-world artifacts. Rather than take the world of objects at face value, we seek to develop transferable ways of working with form to actively question the shape and usage of mass-produced objects. As a starting point, we break down the world of \"making\" into certain procedures (i.e., perforating, extruding, folding) and extend the potential within each in a simple three-dimensional piece, a \"monad\"-or indivisible unit. This language, as well as the qualities that emerge from the physical model, is then questioned in its correlation to existing objects. After developing an extremely acute formal language within this procedure, the student is challenged to pair it with a means of accumulation/assemblage (i.e., stacking, gluing, tabbing, nesting) that can negotiate a scale-shift from product scale to a display wall. We wish to emphasize the relation to the idea of algorithmic development (i.e., a simple unit that is \"grown\" or repetitively made) is partially brought about through the simplistic operation of CNC prototyping equipment in the sense that they incrementally cut, deposit, or remove material. We do not focus on the \"natural\" or \"biomorphic\" aspects of this, but rather look at how these operations are deployed in objects all around us. The question is how an increased sophistication of design can be gained from the loosened constraints of mass standardization that these machines afford.",

This class approaches the concept of \"media change\" from three distinct, interdependent perspectives. First, we consider the social and political forces that compel \"media change,\" from technological determinism to the ideology of media ecology. Second, we visit the creative genres that respond to media change, including low-bit art and music, retro-futurism, remix and open source aesthetics, environmentally-conscious work, and nostalgia-driven work, among others. Finally, we look at the challenges of archiving and preserving new media art, due to its ephemerality and dependence upon dynamic systems. We are visited by artists and preservationists whose practices engage with these questions.

Can one possibly feel immersed? 2X2 is an experiment creative story telling/narrative course exploring a potential new art form, specifically designed to be seen on a small (+/- 2 inches) screen for a short time (+/- 2 minutes).

Interactive media projects and approaches to the design of new media applications are presented weekly; students are thus exposed to commercial and mission-driven applications by the actual designers and creators of these innovative and experimental projects. By way of this process, all first year students, for the first and only time in their ITP experience, are together in one room at one time. As a community, they encounter and respond to the challenges posed by the invited guests. The course provides an overview of current developments in this emerging field and asks students to consider many questions about the state of the art. For example, with the new technologies and applications making their way into almost every phase of the economy and rooting themselves in our day-to-day lives, what can we learn from both the failures and successes? What are the impacts on our society? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space? Class participation, group presentations, and a final paper are required.",

Reading social weather is a basic human skill. Social software—software used for group communications—also has social weather, but it is much harder to read. The culture and behavior of online groups is not as readily apparent as it is in a real room, for several reasons, including limited interfaces, separation of the participants in space and time, and lack of contextual clues. SocialWeather examines how we read the mood and feeling of online spaces and the ways software affects the social weather (and vice versa). The class work consists of both theoretical readings and written observations made “in the field.” The final can be either a research paper documenting some aspect of social software or an attempt to create new interfaces or engines for such software, in order to examine its effects.",

What do these tools have in common—just focusing information? Why are these digital tools generating so much economic, social and political buzz? Do they represent a shift away from an individualistic to a communal civic culture? Does this signify a nascent ‘information society’ dependent on an ‘information state’ to regulate phenomenon such as ‘net neutrality’? Information Contours explores the nature of the information flows that are generated by evolving, innovating, IT and the role of an emerging ‘information state’. For example, will the current economic crisis, with its collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps, signal the onset of new digital economic information tools that will be government mandated to track risk and verify financial products? As the variations of IT (computers, telephony, bio-engineering, software, ecology, DNA, surveillance, simulation, mapping, etc.) increase the quantity of, and applications for, information in society, the cultural, social, economic, political, legal, and ethical ramifications multiply. This course explores these interactions through diverse readings that stimulate class discussion of these exciting topics. IT now suggests the contours that information assumes as the lifeblood of democracy. Yet information, this assumed basic ingredient of democracy, is increasingly produced, manufactured, privatized, and marketed as a commodity. What is “intellectual property” and what role does copyright and patent protection play in expanding or constricting accessible information? Has the free flow of information been undermined by the increasing application and expansion of copyright and patent law to further the privatization, commodification and control of information? As IT becomes more ubiquitous and embedded in culture, transformative issues arise as to its applicability, extension and direction. Civil society is experiencing a shift in the value of information including its nomenclature, applications, and its normative function. Progress in IT increasingly focuses our attention on the way in which information influences culture and thereby informs contemporary democracy. What is the relation between information flows, culture, economics, government, and democracy?",

In particular, networks exhibit emergent characteristics that cannot be explained simply by examining their constituent parts. People are not like computers, but networks of people and networks of computers are alike in many ways. It is the organization of the respective networks that creates those similarities. Network Effects is a course about the structure of networks and how that structure affects human experience. We focus in particular on two invisible networks—communications networks and social networks. Communications networks are invisible in the traditional sense; their inner workings are hidden from us. We examine a variety of communications networks and explore the ways different networks affect the experiences of their users. Social networks are invisible in a different way; because we are so immersed in myriad social networks— friends, family, work, school—we don’t see them. We examine some of the structural elements of social networks, such as strong and weak ties, clustering, and small-worlds networks, to understand some of the ways that the shape of social networks affects us. The goal of the course is to synthesize observations about these two types of networks. Technological choices embodied in electronic networks profoundly affect their social dimensions: Why can we CC people on email but not on phone calls? How does the one-way network of television differ from the two-way network of the Internet? What effect does BitTorrent’s architectural decentralization have on its users? Social choices also affect the design of technology; resistance to spamming or attempts to hide from the RIAA have led to several deep technological changes in the design of blogs and file-sharing networks, respectively, changes that alter the social relations among the users. The class meetings center on discussion of readings and lectures. Outside class, students complete two short papers, a midterm project, and a final paper or project. The midterm project involves designing and implementing a small network (though not necessarily a computer-mediated one) and describing its effects. The final is a project or research interest of the student’s choice and involves designing, building, and describing a network; a visual and descriptive analysis of an existing network; or a research paper.",

There is a growing tension between the economic needs of digital commerce and expectations of privacy as articulated by privacy advocates. What is “privacy”? This course traces and questions whether the historical notion of privacy is adequate to champion individual autonomy in an interactive digital age. The course examines how privacy is increasingly encompassed by information technology. Various computing applications have been proposed, and in some cases implemented, that have the potential of being invasive of privacy such as RFID and the successors to governmental programs such as Total Information Awareness. Is it possible to address privacy concerns with intelligent design of core technologies? What are the privacy issues connected with biometrics, smart cards, data-mining, and pattern analysis? Is privacy an effective or adequate notion for protecting personal information? This course analyzes how in various technical, legal, and political ways, privacy is incapacitated and lost. The course offers new approaches to thinking about what privacy is and what information autonomy means. Privacy is analyzed in terms of existing policies of restraint in contrast to the next generation of embedded privacy. This includes notions such as embedding information autonomy via computing architecture and building privacy parameters into the cyborg imaginary. This course lends itself to one of ITP’s great assets: creativity. Students develop a conceptual understanding of privacy as an identity platform upon which can be embedded the architecture of digital autonomy",

This course looks at techniques for conveying a fuller range of expression over the Internet. Students begin by programming simple chat servers and work toward building tools for transmitting video. Along the way, they learn techniques for making synchronous TCP and UDP, connections, formatting, compressing and parsing data, client/server and peer-to-peer architectures, connecting with physical computing devices, and real-time analysis and synthesis of video images. Another goal of this course is for students to learn to program using Java. Java basics are covered “as needed” for the specific networking techniques covered. This is more of a “by example” course than a comprehensive introduction to Java. The course does not require any previous Java programming experience. It is also fine for students to substitute languages that they already know, like Director or Flash, for some client interfaces.",

    "description": "What does “designing experience” mean? It is an act of choreographing a series of events in the others’ mind. How is it different from, for example, making a movie? In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and “spoon-fed” to the audience (at least on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product’s functionality/ experience. Here, the user’s experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This course explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, students redesign an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, they design a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality. Students are encouraged to explore new 2 vocabulary of interactivity, to expand the lexicon of interactive experience, and to examine the societal role of designing experience.",

The radical change social software brings about is the decoupling of groups in space and time. Realworld conversations require everyone to be in the same place at the same moment; by undoing those restrictions, the Internet has ushered in a host of new social patterns, from the mailing list to the chat room to the blog. Designing such software is a problem that cannot be attacked in the same way as designing a word processor; designers of social software have more in common with economists or political scientists than they do with designers of single-user software, and operators of communal resources have more in common with politicians or landlords than with operators of ordinary Web sites. This course is based on the premise that we have only begun to figure out ways to support these new social patterns. The course begins with an overview of the 40-year history of social software and moves quickly to an examination of the tools and techniques available today, from blogs and wikis to RSS feeds and connectivity through Wi-Fi.

The course traces the interactive imperative, from animated cave paintings and the alphabet to cut-and-paste novels and open source programming. Students encounter literary perspectives from Walter Benjamin to William Burroughs, media theory from Walter Ong to Baudrillard, social critique from Spinoza to Adorno, cultural programming from Genesis P-Orridge to Donna Harraway, and play theory from Huizinga to Howard Rheingold, all in the context of the relationship of interactivity to autonomy and agency. The course also covers the ideas and intentions of some of networking technology’s pioneers, from Vannevar Bush to Norbert Weiner.

Students also look at “throwaway culture”—and the surrounding issues of ethics, impacts, and alternative solutions for discarded technology (currently only 2 percent of consumers will hold onto a particular device for five years or more). Students are asked, “What can we recycle from this throwaway technology and what should we do with what cannot be reused?” This deconstructionist approach to physical computing includes taking an appliance apart, then creating components from the ground up as part of the new system.

The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside— amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go. The public was very limited; children were usually not allowed in. They were elitist institutions whose mission was archiving the past. Today, although most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors, there are fundamental ways—attitudes, techniques, structural issues—that are still lodged in the 19th century. Now, because of a very different kind of Cabinet of Wonder, i.e., the computer and other IT technologies, museums are able to display collections, demonstrate concepts, and reach their audiences in new ways. Most have not taken full advantage of these new tools or had the time to explore how they might change the nature of a museum visit, but we do in this course. We document together the ways in which technology may enhance the museum experience. We evaluate the use of interactive technologies in museums and how that experience might be extended online. But first we observe and study what they do now. We cannot invent a new wheel before we understand the old one. In this course, we explore the different kinds of exhibits in museums (object-based collection, demonstrations of phenomena), historic or single topic museums (e.g., the Tenement Museum), and the varied kinds of venues for exhibits (museums, trade shows, traveling, nature centers). Students learn through experience and discussion a brief history of museums and exhibitions and discover criteria for informal learning environments that differ from schoolroom learning. This course is an exploration, observation, and theory course. You are asked to visit specific museums: an iconic one of each type. These visits are your primary assignments—sometimes accompanied by a reading. A guest speaker from the assigned museum makes an in-class presentation and receives critiques from you. In the second half of the course, we begin to reinvent the museum. What is its purpose in the 21st century? How does the need for a curator change? We look at different museums’ efforts to use technology to take museums beyond the walls, to expand the notion of curators, to include people who don’t have access, or don’t know they do, to the places. And though we focus on museums, we also look at exhibits and other public displays of information. This is not a design or production course.

What is the purpose and value of data produced in experiments? How true are representations crafted with data, and who wants or needs to know about scientific results? What do we gain by incorporating scientific data or visualization into our own work? The goal is to cultivate purposeful science communication and to encourage critical responses to scientific and technological practice in modern culture. Over the course of the class, the focus of each student is on a particular area of science and the aim is to become familiar with its process, language, and data. To do this, students get firsthand experience unpacking particular visualizations, by talking with scientists and students of scientific disciplines, and by interviewing members of potential audiences. Who produces and analyses data, and what are they looking for in their results? Who else is interested in understanding data—and in what setting, through what medium or interface? From these direct experiences, students propose their own art/science collisions: using artistic sensibilities and media tools to communicate about the scientific process, contextualize and annotate visualizations, and frame the chosen topic for particular audiences: museum-goers, policy makers, the disabled, teachers, adults, or children. In periodic “science salons,” students discuss their chosen areas of science, associated datasets and visualizations, affiliated scientists, and potential audiences. Students formulate their own approach to communicating information about science, data, and the topics these inform. Students storyboard three separate explanatory presentations of the data in his or her selected area, each with a separate approach, designed for a unique audience. Students fully develop one idea as a media/interactive presentation for the final project.",

The course examines the possibilities and pitfalls of open-source programming. Students create code as a group and explore how many people working together can contribute to a larger project. Students choose a project to work on collectively during the semester; they design the workings of a code system, build a foundation of code that can be extended and reused, then test the system in several contexts. Students use several open-source software resources and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. Programming is accomplished using Java and/or Processing, and object-oriented software design is explored in depth. Topics of investigation include creating reusable modular code, designing libraries, project planning, and using community software to organize a project. Students should have a working knowledge of Java or Processing and understand the basics of object-oriented programming. Students contribute regularly to a group project and complete a final project. Course work consists of demonstrating and critiquing code and discussing software design techniques.",

The course introduces students to what is needed behind the scenes in order to create “ping-me-and-I’ll-ping-you-back” style text-messaging applications. Class discussion revolves around the future of emerging mobile technology (passive location tracking, proximity detection, etc.) in the context of gaming, social software, etc., using examples that can be found both here in the U.S. and abroad. Techniques covered in the course are geared toward social and location-aware applications, though the class experiments with parsing incoming photo messages, translating semacodes, using geocoders and proximity algorithms, and more. The course focuses heavily on building applications that work on “lowest-common denominator” phones, though students are encouraged to find examples of applications that use emerging technologies (Java and Bluetooth) and discover ways to retrofit these applications to work with the phones we carry in our pockets today. This is not a course on Java/J2ME or Bluetooth development. Students are expected to build at least two working applications during the semester (midterm plus final).",

Students study a broad range of applications, from simple marketing through online trading, political campaigns, activism, and satire, and discuss the relative ethics of using the same techniques for different purposes. How do Web sites guide users toward the “buy” button? How are viral campaigns launched? How do PowerPoint and Microsoft “spellcheck” influence our thought patterns? How do marketers exploit information to craft persuasive messaging? How does the use of manipulative communications techniques change the quality of the media landscape? How do today’s online selling techniques fit into a history of salesmanship and marketing? How do wireless companies hope to get ads on our cell phones? Is the interactive space more or less conducive to manipulative communications?

    "description": "The world abounds with social facts, things that are true because society has decided to behave as if they are true. If you were to turn to a fellow student and say, “I do” or “I sentence you to five years in prison,” your listener would not become your spouse or be hustled off to Rikers. Nothing happens during a wedding or a sentencing hearing; those events are just special forms of talking. Yet talking, in those circumstances, creates real change in the world. There are two nested effects here—the inner one is the conditions under which speech becomes action, and the outer one is the ways we give groups the power to enforce those actions. Social software creates novel contexts for groups, but currently operates outside traditional social support for group action. For example, both corporations and online groups can have high degrees of internal cohesion and strive for external effects on the world, but corporations have the blessing of society, as an official “legal fiction,” to take actions that ordinary groups, no matter how cohesive, are forbidden to take. That gap is mainly one of tradition—one can readily imagine alternate “legal fictions” to support alternate kinds of groups. This course is centered around weekly readings and class discussions of primary materials, some historical, some current, revolving around four questions: What effect does social software have on groups who want to take action in the world? How do groups come to binding decisions about the action they want to take? What are the traditional supports and constraints for real-world groups (corporations, governments, NGOs, etc.) that act on the world? And what new forms of social support can we imagine for groups that are mainly or solely organized online? The course features readings from political and economic theory of group action, the social structure of engaged (as opposed to merely conversational) groups, and field observations of real-world groups using social software. Students are expected to keep a weekly journal, to write midterm and final papers on groups trying to use social software to effect real change in the world. Note: This course is politically neutral. The design issues discussed are relevant to both liberal and conservative political actors. Students interested in taking this course should be comfortable entertaining political ideas they disagree with personally.",

Sending an instant message? Opening a laptop to sign onto the wireless network at Starbucks? Maybe. Clicking on a Web page records your IP address on a Web server somewhere, instant messages are usually sent off unencrypted over the network, and opening a laptop usually requires negotiation with a DHCP server that records your computer’s unique identifier. Our devices and our online interactions leave a mark as unique as our fingerprints; thus, relevant questions are how can we turn those tables?

Generative art creates a process of evolution. Where most art imitates life, generative art has a life of its own. Generative methods have been chained to the personal computer for too long. The course asks the question, what would happen if we took the algorithms employed in software art and applied them to the physical world through sensors and reactive elements? Or, as in Ned Kahn’s piece “Wind,” what if we were to apply laws of nature to physical works? In this course, we apply simple rules to dictate the shape or function of a work, and add to it an inherent complexity that is both beautiful and intelligent. By combining a set of simple rules, or a system, with physical computing, we marry the work to the intention of the artist. This helps us define what we are doing when we create and allows us to take the assignments beyond exercises in executing basic electronics. Living art extracts the generative approach from the personal computer and applies it to the physical world. In some cases it is very clear how we can apply generative methods in the use of motors or light grids, but how might we apply fuzzy logic, for example?

As a sensor the video camera is appealing, delivering up to 36 million bytes every second compared to maybe three bytes from a keyboard. Accessories and knowledge for using cameras are mainstream. For instance, by simply changing lenses, the same sensor once used for your fingers can now be aimed at a city block. Even very inexpensive computers are now fast enough to not only record frames of video but also to look through the individual pixels. It is no wonder cameras have become a standard accessory for computers (especially in cell phones). The difficulty of computer vision comes when you expect your software to be able to mimic the powers of the human brain to interpret arbitrary images. This course attempts to sidestep the difficult parts if you are willing to work in fairly contrived environments such as art installations, eye tracking rigs, or ant farms. The course covers software techniques for tracking objects in video, background removal, blob detection, as well as tricks on the optical side of the equation.

In this course, students build on software and hardware tool kits to create hands-on experiments tapping less conscious parts of our experience. Initial topics include using a cell phone as personal sensor logger and visualizing the results; capturing subtle body language (e.g., eye-tracking) and transmitting it over a network; triggering and detecting subconscious activity (e.g., EEG); and the transition from communication to expression. Throughout the course, we relate these techniques to the advantages of introducing computers at all such as search, storage, and transmission. In the first half of the semester, students work in groups to create quick prototypes. The second half of the semester focuses on final projects.",

How does interactivity impact narrative perception, rhythm, and arc? Is the interface user-driven or machine-driven? Multilinear or singular? Screen or object based? Do we want to work for our stories? Is it possible to make profound or emotional narrative work in a multilinear or interactive environment? The creation and evaluation of work in this course pivots on the notion of narrative perception: a viewer’s desire to actively make story out of represented moments, from Chaplin’s silent movies to U.S. Army recruitment ads to de Kooning’s paintings of women. The emphasis of this course is more conceptual than technical and more narrative than formal. Students work on the creation of time-based cinematic forms through short- and medium length assignments. Students work in a range of media, from paper maps to multi-screens. In addition, students are expected to engage in critical dialogue through individual research and presentation of precedents, from new media art projects, readings, and experimental or mainstream film.",

Interactivity, the passage of time, and resolution are just a few of the ideas that are being explored. Yet these ideas are new only in the sense that they are being adapted to new media. For example, in painting and sculpture, Renaissance and baroque artists used a variety of means to actively engage the viewer; the concept of continuous narrative, reaching back to the Egyptians, aims to convey the passage of time; and the notion of resolution has been variously interpreted by Titian, Seurat, Cézanne, de Kooning, Close, and many others. This course examines how artists throughout history have utilized various media and techniques to effect formal, conceptual, and experiential dynamics comparable to those being investigated by new media artists today. The goal of the course is not only to provide students with knowledge of the immensely rich history of artistic creativity, but also—and more important—to provide a platform through which that knowledge may be utilized to reconsider new media strategies of artistic expression. Through observation, discussion, reading, and projects (both written and hands-on), students acquire mental tools to approach their own work with an expanded understanding of artistic possibility. This course is not a dry art history survey and is not conducted as such. Organized thematically, rather than chronologically, the focus of each class is on a different concept derived from the field of new media production and examined with regard to artistic precedents.

These issues fall roughly into three categories: environment and ecology, economic development, and human rights equity. There are massive changes needed in all of these areas. The point of this two-point seminar is to research and discuss how these issues relate to our work in interaction design and digital media production and to determine how the ITP community can have the most positive impact. In order to limit the scope of our research to something manageable within the semester, we focus mainly on environmental issues, starting with these central questions: What can we change here and now? What impact do our practices have on the environment, and what changes can we make to lessen the damage we do and increase any positive effects our work has? What skills or ideas do we bring to the table that can have the best effect? What are the most important things for a long-range sustainability program at ITP to focus on? In looking for answers to these questions, we attempt to address both our practice here at ITP and the assumptions we take with us into work and life after ITP. We build an online resource for ourselves and others based on what we learn in the process. This might include reading lists, suggested actions to be taken, links to sources of useful materials and tools for designers and artists, and to organizations whose work overlaps ours. We implement what changes we can and make suggestions on those that will take longer. For several of the class meetings, guest practitioners from a variety of areas join the class to discuss how their work is affected by these issues. The class is broken into groups of four, and each group is expected to research a given guest’s work and prepare to lead the class conversation with the guest. Students are expected to read and research widely on the issues addressed in the class, report on their findings, participate actively in discussions in class and online, and to begin to take action in their own practices.",

Presupposing a relationship between computer code and social codes calls into question the larger nature and value of systems and the means by which one might effectively change them. The political, phenomenological, and practical problems raised by this set of issues form the backdrop for this course, in which we survey tactical media works developed since the 1960s, with an emphasis on work since 1995. We look at artists’ use of a variety of media— including the news media, the Internet, locative media, surveillance techniques, genetic modification, software viruses, memes, live performance, the audience, and more—to carry out protests. We also visit precursors to tactical media, including that which is typically referred to as “protest art” and important media intervention projects. The relationship between the evolution of communication media and the shift in tactics is among our core concerns. We hear from guest lecturers and read a combination of theoretical texts, seminal curatorial statements, manifestos, and mainstream press response to these interventions. An emphasis on media specificity leads to discussions focused on design questions and other practical considerations, with regard to participants’ own work.

    "description": "Whether we design an application for the small touch pad of a cell phone, a game for an elderly user, or produce art through a self-defined conviction, our work is often driven by constraints— some chosen, others imposed. With digital technologies, one other constraint is our own ability to keep up with the ever shifting tools that we use. Does this perpetual learning curve stifle our creative process? Or in contrast, can an abundance of technical know-how cloud a simple vision? The goal of this course is to make work that is fueled by the positive constraints (our audience, our vision) rather then the damaging ones (our lack of ability to know everything about the tools we use). Through weekly assignments, we draw ideas and production techniques from art, game design, music (sound art), cognitive science, and universal design toward an understanding of how to carry our initial ideas through a development process, without compromising quality and clarity of vision. For a final assignment, students are asked to create a project for a specific target audience, defined by age/gender/ race/culture and ability. The goal is to allow oneself a space for exploration while working toward a focused result. Some ideas for projects may include simplifying an application for the growing elderly population (can grandmama really use that fancy Nokia phone?), a software game based solely on audio (ever played Doom without a monitor in a dark room?), or an art piece that clearly conveys your artistic intentions with a digital medium (think of interactive art that’s not utterly frustrating/ annoying for gallery goers). In either case, we test our work early and often (starting midsemester), learn to identify problems, and solve them through an iterative design process. When needed, software examples are programmed using Processing. We also use simple pcomp modules to quicken exploration (such as custom keyboard emulators). A fair understanding of ICM and pcomp is required, as you are asked not to spend the majority of your energy learning new technologies, but rather make the best of what you already know.

The seminar functions as both an introduction to different CNC + prototyping equipment as well as a studio in which to test the possibilities and constraints of these new methods of production. Using 3D printing, laser cutting, and milling, we develop a language of “making” that can be brought to bear on two different scales: product and display wall. The seminar works within various scripting and modeling environments as a means to both work with form and translate form into real-world artifacts. Rather than take the world of objects at face value, we seek to develop transferable ways of working with form to actively question the shape and usage of mass-produced objects. As a starting point, we break down the world of “making” into certain procedures (i.e., perforating, extruding, folding) and extend the potential within each in a simple three-dimensional piece, a “monad”— or indivisible unit. This language, as well as the qualities that emerge from the physical model, is then questioned in its correlation to existing objects. After developing an extremely acute formal language within this procedure, the student is challenged to pair it with a means of accumulation/assemblage (i.e., stacking, gluing, tabbing, nesting) that can negotiate a scale-shift from product scale to a display wall. We wish to emphasize the relation to the idea of algorithmic development (i.e., a simple unit that is “grown” or repetitively made) is partially brought about through the simplistic operation of CNC prototyping equipment in the sense that they incrementally cut, deposit, or remove material. We do not focus on the “natural” or “biomorphic” aspects of this, but rather look at how these operations are deployed in objects all around us. The question is how an increased sophistication of design can be gained from the loosened constraints of mass standardization that these machines afford.",

If you open a copy of Word and create a file, it isn’t “user generated content.” If Stephen King opens Word and writes a book, that isn’t it either. Somehow your local file doesn’t count, while it isn’t a surprise that Mr. King’s novel finds readers. When we talk about user-generated content, and indeed user-generated anything, we are actually talking about a theory of social relations— user-generated content can’t be done by professionals and must have an audience. This course looks at both examples and theories of user-generated content, including blogging, wikis, online photos and video, and even user-generated editorial judgment and categorization systems.",

    "description": "It’s been said that “change alone is eternal.” This certainly applies to technology in a culture that calls for constant upgrades in operating systems, software, programming languages, consumer gadgets, medical devices, military machinery, etc. These technological changes follow from and generate cultural shifts, as well as divisions in creative genres (emerging partly from the reorganization of form/content/tool relationships) and challenges to those who seek to make, collect, and preserve art in variable media. This course approaches the concept of “media change” from three distinct, interdependent perspectives. First, we consider the social and political forces that compel “media change,” from technological determinism to the ideology of media ecology. Second, we visit the creative genres that respond to media change, including low bit art and music, retro-futurism, remix and open source aesthetics, environmentally- conscious work, and nostalgia-driven work, among others. Finally, we look at the challenges of archiving and preserving new media art, due to its ephemerality and dependence upon dynamic systems. We are visited by artists and preservationists whose practices engage with these questions. The course addresses larger philosophical questions and a lot of fun art, while concerning itself with practical solutions to the challenges (or opportunities) at hand. Students work toward a final creative project.",

Now film is viewable on handheld devices (phones, palms, iPods, MP3 players), and people are watching movies on these devices that are meant for the big screen and a communal experience (theater), or they are watching short-format forms, such as commercials and music videos, which are meant for TV and whose purpose is selling stuff. Will a new art form emerge out of this? Will there be a new vocabulary? Will visuals become less important? Sound more important? Can one be moved to action, to tears, to laughter in a short time and small space? Can one possibly feel immersed? 2X2 is an experiment—a creative storytelling/narrative course exploring a potential new art form, specifically designed to be seen on a small (+/- 2 inches) screen for a short time (+/- 2 minutes). Emphasis is on story, not production, not interaction, not theory. We explore narrative possibilities in both nonfiction (e.g., essay forms, minidocs,) and fiction (e.g., stories, poetry, performance). In some assignments, students work with other people’s stories; in others, they create their own. In a collaboration created for this course, students have access to and permission to use the Magnum Photo archive (www.magnumphotos.com). The class follows a “creative writing” style format. Each week there are two assignments. These are quick sketches/rough drafts; a specific exercise is given at the end of each class, which has two aspects: a topic/theme (e.g., confess to an emotional crime), and a form restriction (e.g., use no words). In each class, students present their work for critique. Every week each student adds an episode, randomly assigned, to someone else’s story created the previous week. For a final project, each student picks two of their individual assignments (one fiction, one nonfiction) to take to a more finished level. The last class is a film festival with outside reviewers.",

The forms need not be traditional architectural constructs, but new strategies towards defining an architecture that can be expressed through new technologies. Students are encouraged to imagine the impossible and to integrate meta-forms into the contemporary city. Science fiction sites, transportation paths, urban anomalies, invisible boundaries, and temporary autonomous zone are examined and developed as meta-form habitats. The semester long project is divided into two parts: expressions and interventions. The first section, expressions, addresses contemporary architectural tendencies that unfold to inhabit the spaces of urban environments. The second part, interventions, activates communication strategies to connect the meta-forms to actual public spaces within New York City. The class work culminates in final presentations critiqued by guest reviewers from related fields. No prerequisites or architectural experience is needed, however, previous knowledge of at least one programming language is strongly recommended (Processing, MaxMSP/Jitter, Maya, Flash etc.).

Basically, the course integrates Pcomp and Computational Media into the history of drawing and human ideas about the drawing process—and puts them in context. Students explore drawing in whatever medium they choose, it need not be technological— the idea is to generate a “working tool set.” This could mean exploring a certain aspect of MaxMSP or Processing or Arduino for example. The point is that drawing is an oddly physical and intellectual activity—one can’t have one without the other. Can we bring some of this “physicalness” into how we understand our technological tools? Also, can we begin thinking about the sketchbook as a “machine for ideas?” The course is as much about “drawing machines” as it is about developing/refining a creative process. The course requires students to keep a online sketch diary of their process, and there is a final project where students explore in depth some aspect of what they researched over the semester.",

Claude Levi- Strauss’ observation that “animals are good to think” is the starting point from which we make, discuss, and examine the ways in which works of art imagine the interrelationships between the human, the animal, and our environment. If we can only perceive these things through mediation (media representations), then how we represent them is the fundamental question, reflecting our ideologies, prejudices, hopes, and fears. Do we speak for animals, and if so what are we saying for them? Are they friends, pets, environmental equals, or beasts? How are hybrid monsters (chimera) created and what do they mean? How do we understand our places as subjects in a landscape or a datascape? How can anthropomorphic cuteness be subversive? This course focuses on questions of intention, relation, and subjectivity, through critical engagement with representations of people, animals, monsters, and mutants, in their respective environments. The class is further focused on the use of character in context, via toy design, robotics, animation, video, image generation, or data visualization. There are introductory texts on character development, and generally an emphasis on literary, philosophical, and natural history texts, including Jorge Luis Borges, John Berger, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway, Rebecca Solnit, Steve Baker, Deleuze, and Guattari. Assignments include studio work and readings. There is more emphasis on the development and analysis of ideas, and less emphasis on particular media or forms. Students make several short projects, backed up by readings and research into precedent art works. There is a final project. Class is a combination of studio critique, responses to art works, reading, and discussion.",

This paradigm is based on mapping out the flow of the data, which more closely mirrors the experience of realtime media. We start with the basics of Pd itself, and cover the basics of audio, video, 3D, physical computing, networking, and how to organize large projects. Pd is free software, and also runs on embedded systems like PDAs and iPhones, providing possibilities previously only feasible using microcontrollers. The Max paradigm is compared to object-oriented languages like Processing to provide an idea of their differences and similarities, as well as their respective strengths and weaknesses. This course is structured around learning by doing, so students have regular assignments to explore the ideas covered in class, as well as a final project. The focus is on Pd, but much of this knowledge is applicable to Max/MSP as well.",

The course covers object-oriented programming, C/Objective-C/Objective- C++, scripting languages, OS X internals, Interface Builder, and XCode. The Cocoa and Cocoa Touch APIs covered include Quartz, OpenGL, Core Location, CFNetwork (wifi), as well open source frameworks such as GData (Google) and XMPPFramework (Jabber). Access to a Mac running OS X 10.5 is the minimum requirement, but having a real Cocoa Touch device like the iPhone or the iPod Touch to test on will make the class more enjoyable. The course is highly technical in nature and is geared to intermediate to advanced programmers, or extremely dedicated beginners. That said, the goal of the course is to actively and creatively explore this new field of little computers using the iPhone as the main research platform.",

    "description": "Our bodies are ripe with the potential to express and perceive, but aspects of our physical selves are often ignored by the devices and communication systems that we use. Even as our technologies become smaller and more versatile, we find ourselves bending down towards our keyboards and screens, and much of what we communicate with our bodies gets lost in translation. In Thinking Physically, we work to open ourselves back up and embrace the rich capabilities and inherent expressiveness of the human form. Starting with the body itself, we think about how it works and take a brief look at motion studies and biomechanics. Next, we examine how we use our bodies to relate to each other, considering physical social perceptions, proxemics, and cultural contexts. We then work to become better listeners, striving to sense the subtleties of body language, gesture, and nonverbal communication. Finally, it’s time to put those listening skills to work, designing interfaces that perceive the body’s communicative nature and encourage people to interact in a more physical way. Thinking Physically is a hands-on workshop in which we get up and move. Students create experiments and prototypes (both conceptual and technical) in response to weekly topics and design a body-centric final project based on what they’ve learned. Curated uses of the body (dance, physical comedy, sports, etc.), act as inspiration, but students focus on the everyman as the target user for the projects they create. With a toolbox of sensors, wearable techniques, and rugged interfaces in hand, we capture and provoke full-bodied expression. By acknowledging and extending the body’s impact, we create projects that appeal to the whole physical self.",

    "description": "Even the simplest exchange among strangers can contain a tangled accumulation of meanings: What transpires may have physical, emotional, social, political, technological, and historical dimensions. This course takes an analytical approach to unraveling and understanding these charged moments. In the process of the studying how and why strangers interact in public, we address some of the abiding themes at ITP— urban behavior, spontaneous interaction, the pleasure of the unexpected, how technology can mediate and/or enable human experience—and we make a close and thorough examination of how they play out in this narrow slice of human experience. This approach is designed to bring students to a more concrete understanding of these larger abstract ideas. Classwork consists of readings, class discussions, field assignments (a series of assigned interactions with strangers that the students document and discuss) and an analytical final paper. Students learn how the interactions of strangers have changed historically (and why), what the experience of interaction with strangers means to the participants, how strangers ‘read’ each other, how they initiate interactions, how they avoid interactions, how they trust each other and how they fool each other. Readings range from seminal works on urban sociology and public behavior (Georg Simmel, Stanley Milgram, Erving Goffman, Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Elijah Anderson) to more lyrical examinations of strangers in cities (Tim Etchells, Italo Calvino, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Edgar Allan Poe) to recent neuropsychiatric discoveries about trust, mimicry, and flash judgments. Because stranger interactions are at heart a means to interrupt the expected narrative of the everyday, we consider the works of artists and thinkers who show how such disruption, surprise, spontaneity, and play are fundamental to the pleasure and substance of urban life, for example: the Situationists and their descendents, Sophie Calle, Marina Abramovic, Francis Alys, Graffiti Research Lab, Robert Rauschenberg, Survival Research Labs. We also explore recent art/technology projects that specifically engage strangers, such as Familiar Strangers, the Listening Station, PostSecret, Oddible, Loca: Set to Discoverable, Following the Man in the Crowd, Mobile Feelings, and others.",

In this course, we explore many prototyping forms, methods and techniques to better understand where, when and how prototypes can be applied to inform a design. Through a series of challenges and group exercises, students create prototypes to explore, validate and test ideas. Students should come to this course with a big idea. This is the perfect environment to take on something that has not been done, something risky or difficult to approach. As a class, we work collaboratively to identify, implement and document the process and use of prototypes to further realize the idea and design. Throughout this course, students develop a body of work in the form of sketches, models and semi-functional objects. The value comes not from the volume or quality of what you produce, but rather from what you learn and how you apply that knowledge back into the design. Documentation and presentation of process are essential. The course is conducted as a design studio with weekly discussions, presentations of work and assigned readings.

This in turn has inspired the range of voices that have stepped forward to examine the phenomenon of games and its artifacts. In this course, we survey the major work that has been done to understand games, both digital and traditional, in the past sixty years. Starting with foundational texts by historian Johan Huizinga and sociologist Roger Caillois, up to the present day where movements like ‘New Games Journalism’ seek to place games in the more personal context of a single human life. While the class seeks to understand games from theoretical and historical perspectives, the focus is on students bringing their own interpretations to bear. Through short essays and presentations students connect theory to real-world examples and develop their own opinions and perspectives through discussion with other students. This course is for anyone interested in understanding the history of games and the enormous world of thought that surrounds them.",

As the available inputs and UI change with each device, so does the content, design limitations, and the narrative. We currently live in a world where we interact with content in three main environments: one foot—cell phone/iPod, two foot—computer, and 10-foot—television and with each of these devices we have to accommodate our content and interaction accordingly, and allow for the content to follow the user between these devices, but maintain a classic and intuitive user experience. This course looks at these problems on a per-project basis and looks to solve them at a granular level.

This course critically examines the design of these technologies as they play on specific human emotions and vulnerabilities. In the spirit of transparency and ethical investigation, we explore approaches to subverting, upending, and exposing our relation to such technologies. Furthermore, we examine the power of persuasive technologies in creating opportunities for communicating non-human intentions and viewpoints. Readings range from Douglas Adams on Genuine People Personalities, to Frank Herbert’s Without Me, You’re Nothing, Friedrich Juenger’s The Failure of Technology, to BJ Fogg, Nass, and Rives, and the work in Critical Design by Dunne and Raby, among others. Through class discussion, readings and examples we identify human emotional/ social touchpoints: jealousy, seduction, fear, risk, reward, etc. Students conduct their own analyses of a manipulation technique, and of its corresponding persuasive technology application. For the second assignment students develop and present a persuasive technology concept for a non-human object or viewpoint. An example might be Play Coalition’s “PlantBot,” which puts plants in control of their own mobility based on their need for sunlight. For midterm, guest critics provide feedback to students’ presentations of their final project concepts.

What do these tools have in common-just focusing information? Why are these digital tools generating so much economic, social and political buzz? Do they represent a shift away from an individualistic to a communal civic culture? Does this signify a nascent ‘information society’ dependent on an information state' to regulate phenomenon such as ‘net neutrality’? Information Contours explores the nature of the information flows that are generated by evolving, innovating, IT and the role of an emerging ‘information state’. For example, will the current economic crisis, with its collateralized debt obligations and unit default swaps, signal the onset of new digital economic information tools that will be government mandated to track risk and verify financial products? As the variations of IT (computers, telephony, bio-engineering, software, ecology, DNA, surveillance, simulation, mapping, etc.) increase the quantity of, and applications for, information in society, the cultural, social, economic, political, legal, and ethical ramifications multiply. This course explores these interactions through diverse readings that stimulate class discussion of these exciting topics. IT now suggests the contours that information assumes as the lifeblood of democracy. Yet information, this assumed basic ingredient of democracy, is increasingly produced, manufactured, privatized, and marketed as a commodity. What is \"intellectual property\" and what role does copyright and patent protection play in expanding or constricting accessible information? Has the free flow of information been under mined by the increasing application and expansion of copyright and patent law to further the privatization, commodification and control of information? As IT becomes more ubiquitous and embedded in culture, transformative issues arise as to its applicability, extension and direction. Civil society is experiencing a shift in the value of information including its nomenclature, applications, and its normative function. Progress in IT increasingly focuses our attention on the way in which information influences culture and thereby informs contemporary democracy. What is the relation between information flows, culture, economics, government, and democracy?",

Students begin by analyzing narrative in storytelling, theatre, the written word, comics, and film. They then go on to translate the main components of the story to interactive media by developing scripts for interactive storytelling projects and performance. Weekly readings include both examples of myth and story as well as critical approaches to their structure-the Bible, Aristotle, Joseph Campbell, Russian folktakes, Ibsen, Shaw, Brecht, Robert McKee (story), Scott McCloud, a fantasy roleplaying game, a bit of Rushkoff, and a novel by either Dick, Stephenson, Gibson, or Sterling. Classes consist of seminar discussions, as well as active experimentation with storytelling. Students tell a story, write a short story, a scene for a movie, and a short sequential narrative. They then develop either individually or in groups-stories for new media or new media scenarios, such as SMS, the Internet, or technologically augmented performance. This course provides a strong foundation for students interested in taking Rushkoff's Postlinear Narrative lab.",

Scenario planning is a rigorous but highly engaging technique, in which people share information and judgment to create a picture of the future larger than any individual could produce alone. The technique has been used since the mid-1950s decades to distinguish certainties from uncertainties, and to learn to be prepared for multiple eventualities. Students will conduct original research on significant trends, use those trends to develop compelling, plausible stories about possible futures, and present the futures-and the strategies they suggest-to a public audience.

    "description": "Networks exist in the spaces between things; they require both concrete entities (computers, people, businesses) and abstract relations (protocols, friendships, contracts). We understand intuitively that networked computers differ from stand-alone computers, or that a group of friends differs from an aggregation of anonymous individuals, but describing that difference clearly is difficult. In particular, networks exhibit emergent characteristics that cannot be explained simply by examining their constituent parts. People are not like computers, but networks of people and networks of computers are alike in many ways. It is the organization of the respective networks that creates those similarities. Network Effects is a course about the structure of networks and how that structure affects human experience. We focus in particular on two invisible networks-communications networks and social networks. Communications networks are invisible in the traditional sense; their inner workings are hidden from us. We examine a variety of communications networks and explore the ways different networks affect the experiences of their users. Social networks are invisible in a different way; because we are so immersed in myriad social networks-friends, family, work, school-we don't see them. We examine some of the structural elements of social networks, such as strong and weak ties, clustering, and small-worlds networks, to understand some of the ways that the shape of social networks affects us. The goal of the course is to synthesize observations about these two types of networks. Technological choices embodied in electronic networks profoundly affect their social dimensions: Why can we CC people on email but not on phone calls? How does the one-way network of television differ from the two-way network of the Internet? What effect does BitTorrent's architectural decentralization have on its users? Social choices also affect the design of technology; resistance to spamming or attempts to hide from the RIAA have led to several deep technological changes in the design of blogs and file-sharing networks, respectively, changes that alter the social relations among the users. The class meetings center on discussion of readings and lectures. Outside class students complete two short papers, a midterm project, and a final paper or project. The midterm project involves designing and implementing a small network (though not necessarily a computer-mediated one) and describing its effects. The final is a project or research interest of the student's choice and involves designing, building, and describing a network; a visual and descriptive analysis of an existing network; or a research paper.",

There is a growing tension between the economic needs of digital commerce and expectations of privacy as articulated by privacy advocates. What is \"privacy\"? This course traces and questions whether the historical notion of privacy is adequate to champion individual autonomy in an interactive digital age. The course examines how privacy is increasingly encompassed by information technology. Various computing applications have been proposed, and in some cases implemented, that have the potential of being invasive of privacy such as RFID and the successors to governmental programs such as Total Information Awareness. Is it possible to address privacy concerns with intelligent design of core technologies? What are the privacy issues connected with biometrics, smart cards, data-mining, and pattern analysis? Is privacy an effective or adequate notion for protecting personal information? This course analyzes how in various technical, legal, and political ways, privacy is incapacitated and lost. The course offers new approaches to thinking about what privacy is and what information autonomy means. Privacy is analyzed in terms of existing policies of restraint in contrast to the next generation of embedded privacy. This includes notions such as embedding information autonomy via computing architecture and building privacy parameters into the cyborg imaginary. This course lends itself to one of ITP's great assets: creativity. Students develop a conceptual understanding of privacy as an identity platform upon which can be embedded the architecture of digital autonomy.",

In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and \"spoon-fed\" to the audience (at least on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product's functionality/experience. Here, the user's experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This course explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, students redesign an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, they design a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality.

Designing such software is a problem that cannot be attacked in the same way as designing a word processor; designers of social software have more in common with economists or political scientists than they do with designers of single-user software, and operators of communal resources have more in common with politicians or landlords than with operators of ordinary Web sites.

For longer than we might imagine, cultural theorists have foreseen these shifts, feared them, fought for them, celebrated them, and, clearly, misunderstood them. This seminar explores the thread of interactivity in cultural media as well as the opportunities and perils posed by the associated rise of mass interpretation, authorship, and bottom-up organization. The course traces the interactive imperative, from animated cave paintings and the alphabet to cut-and-paste novels and open source programming Students encounter literary perspectives from Walter Benjamin to William Burroughs, media theory from Walter Ong to Baudrillard, social critique from Spinoza to Adorno, cultural programming from Genesis P-Orridge to Donna Harraway, and play theory from Huizinga to Howard Rheingold, all in the context of the relationship of interactivity to autonomy and agency. The course also covers the ideas and intentions of some of networking technology's pioneers, from Vannevar Bush to Norbert Weiner. Students are required to read approximately one book per week, lead one class discussion, supplement one class discussion with audiovisual resources, and write two short papers arguing a cogent theoretical perspective on new media.",

This includes using elements from existing appliances and construct ing one's own homemade circuit boards. The focus is on cost-effective methods of construction. On a larger scale, the course also considers how entire systems may be repurposed with little modification to the original system. This may include looking into the workings of common appliances. The course examines both the hardware and the software sides of recycling technology. Students also look at \"throwaway culture\"-a the surrounding issues of ethics, impacts, and alternative solutions for discarded technology (currently only 2 percent of consumers will hold onto a particular device for five years or more). Students are asked, \"What can we recycle from this throwaway technology and what should we do with what cannot be reused?\" This deconstructionist approach to physical computing includes taking an appliance apart, then creating components from the ground up as part of the new system. By co-opting the components of other systems and combining them with our own, the students have the opportunity to explore the makeup of a system, create a new one, and provide commentary about technology in today's culture.

    "description": "If you were inventing a museum today, what would it look like? Who would be there? What would its main purpose be? Before you answer that question, let's take a look back. The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside-amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go. The public was very limited; children were usually not allowed in. They were elitist institutions whose mission was archiving the past. Today, although most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors, there are fundamental ways-attitudes, techniques, structural issues-that are still lodged in the 19th century. Now, because of a very different kind of Cabinet of Wonder, i.e., the computer and other IT technologies, museums are able to display collections, demonstrate concepts, and reach their audiences in new ways. Most have not taken full advantage of these new tools or had the time to explore how they might change the nature of a museum visit, but we do in this course. We document together the ways in which technology may enhance the museum experience. We evaluate the use of interactive technologies in museums and how that experience might be extended online. But first we observe and study what they do now. We cannot invent a new wheel before we understand the old one. In this course, we explore the different kinds of exhibits in museums (object-based collection, demonstrations of phenomena), historic or single topic museums (e.g., the Tenement Museum), and the varied kinds of venues for exhibits (museums, trade shows, traveling, nature centers). Students learn through experience and discussion a brief history of museums and exhibitions and discover criteria for informal learning environments that differ from schoolroom learning. This course is an exploration, observation, and theory course. You are asked to visit specific museums: an iconic one of each type These visits are your primary assignnents-sometimes accompanied by a reading. A guest speaker from the assigned museum makes an in-class presentation and receives critiques from you. In the second half of the course, we begin to reinvent the museum. What is its purpose in the 21st century? How does the need for a curator change? We look at different museums' efforts to use technology to take museums beyond the walls, to expand the notion of curators, to include people who don't have access, or don't know they do, to the places. And though we focus on museums, we also look at exhibits and other public displays of information. This is not a design or production course. The assignments are field trips to museums, readings, and writing. The course is primarily discussion-based, and class participation is a major part of the grade.",

What do we gain by incorporating scientific data or visualization into our own work? The goal is to cultivate purposeful science communication and to encourage critical responses to scientific and technological practice in modern culture. Over the course of the class, the focus of each student is on a particular area of science and the aim is to become familiar with its process, language, and data. To do this, students get firsthand experience unpacking particular visualizations, by talking with scientists and students of scientific disciplines, and by interviewing members of potential audiences. Who produces and analyses data, and what are they looking for in their results? Who else is interested in understanding data-and in what setting, through what medium or interface? From these direct experiences, students propose their own art/science collisions: using artistic sensibilities and media tools to communicate about the scientific process, contextualize and annotate visualizations, and frame the chosen topic for particular audiences: museumgoers, policy makers, the disabled, teachers, adults, or children. In periodic “science salons,” students discuss their chosen areas of science, associated datasets and visualizations, affiliated scientists, and potential audiences. Students formulate their own approach to communicating information about science, data, and the topics these inform.

If you were to turn to a fellow student and say, \"I do\" or \"I sentence you to five years in prison,\" your listener would not become your spouse or be hustled off to Rikers. Nothing happens during a wedding or a sentencing hearing; those events are just special forms of talking. Yet talking, in those circumstances, creates real change in the world. There are two nested effects here-the inner one is the conditions under which speech becomes action, and the outer one is the ways we give groups the power to enforce those actions. Social software creates novel contexts for groups, but currently operates outside traditional social support for group action. For example, both corporations and online groups can have high degrees of internal cohesion and strive for external effects on the world, but corporations have the blessing of society, as an official \"legal fiction,\" to take actions that ordinary groups, no matter how cohesive, are forbidden to take. That gap is mainly one of tradition-on can readily imagine alternate \"legal fictions\" to support alternate kinds of groups. This course is centered around weekly readings and class discussions of primary materials, some historical, some current, revolving around four questions What effect does social software have on groups who want to take action in the world? How do groups come to binding decisions about the action they want to take? What are the traditional supports and constraints for real-world groups (corporations, governments, NGOs, etc.) that act on the world? And what new forms of social support can we imagine for groups that are mainly or solely organized online? The course features readings from political and economic theory of group action, the social structure of engaged (as opposed to merely conversational) groups, and field observations of real-world groups using social software. Students are expected to keep a weekly journal, to write midterm and final papers on groups trying to use social software to effect real change in the world. Note: This course is politically neutral.

    "description": "Living art combines physical computing and generative art techniques, providing an environment for students interested in pursuing an artistic outlet for their physical computing skills. Generative art creates a process of evolution. Where most art imitates life, generative art has a life of its own. Generative methods have been chained to the personal computer for too long. The course asks the question, what would happen if we took the algorithms employed in software art and applied them to the physical world through sensors and reactive elements? Or, as in Ned Kahn's piece \"Wind,\" what if we were to apply laws of nature to physical works? In this course, we apply simple rules to dictate the shape or function of a work, and add to it an inherent complexity that is both beautiful and intelligent. By combining a set of simple rules, or a system, with physical computing, we marry the work to the intention of the artist. This helps us define what we are doing when we create and allows us to take the assignments beyond exercises in executing basic electronics. Living art extracts the generative approach from the personal computer and applies it to the physical world. In some cases it is very clear how we can apply generative methods in the use of motors or light grids, but how might we apply fuzzy logic, for example? This course is for students who have completed Introduction to Physical Computing.",

As a sensor the video camera is appealing, delivering up to 36 million bytes every second compared to maybe three bytes from a keyboard. Accessories and knowledge for using cameras are mainstream. For instance, by simply changing lenses, the same sensor once used for your fingers can now be aimed at a city block. Even very inexpensive computers are now fast enough to not only record frames of video but also to look through the individual pixels. It is no wonder cameras have become a standard accessory for computers (especially in cell phones). The difficulty of computer vision comes when you expect your software to be able to mimic the powers of the human brain to interpret arbitrary images. This course attempts to sidestep the difficult parts if you are willing to work in fairly contrived environments such as art installations, eye tracking rigs, or ant farms. The course covers software techniques for tracking objects in video, background removal, blob detection, as well as tricks on the optical side of the equation. Video tracking in real time requires a coding parsimony that can be used as a challenging method to improve a student's overall coding skills. The course uses Java in the Eclipse environment, which is a good next step from the Processing environment. We look at implementing these techniques across platforms, including the desktop, the cell phone, and even on a microcontroller.

Students work through a series of discrete design exercises covering basic concepts such as affordance, feedback, and modality. These exercises cover different types of interactive experiences, from simple, appliance-like design problems to dense information systems. Students gain a hands-on understanding of how to combine physical controls and screen-based design elements to support different types of interactions. In the second section, students acquire the tools and methods to conduct primary research with end-users, deriving relevant insights from direct observational research to shape their design solutions In the final section, we look at some of the prevailing models for interactive systems, drawing from gaming, Web 2.0, and pervasive computing.

On the other hand, going past conscious control can be associated with achieving virtuosity in the arts and athletics, acquiring insight into your personality and engendering trust in conversation. In this course, students build on software and hardware tool kits to create hands-on experiments tapping less conscious parts of our experience. Initial topics include using a cell phone as personal sensor logger and visualizing the results; capturing subtle body language (e.g., eye-tracking) and transmitting it over a network; triggering and detecting subconscious activity (e.g., EEG); and the transition from communication to expression. Throughout the course, we relate these techniques to the advantages of introducing computers at all such as search, storage, and transmission.

Interactivity, the passage of time, and resolution are just a few of the ideas that are being explored. Yet these ideas are new only in the sense that they are being adapted to new media. For example, in painting and sculpture, Renaissance and baroque artists used a variety of means to actively engage the viewer; the concept of continuous narrative, reaching back to the Egyptians, aims to convey the passage of time; and the notion of resolution has been variously interpreted by Titian, Seurat, Cezanne, de Kooning, Close, and many others. This course examines how artists throughout history have utilized various media and techniques to effect formal, conceptual, and experiential dynamics comparable to those being investigated by new media artists today. The goal of the course is not only to provide students with knowledge of the immensely rich history of artistic creativity, but also-and more important-to provide a platform through which that knowledge may be utilized to reconsider new media strategies of artistic expression. Through observation, discussion, reading, and projects (both written and hands-on), students acquire mental tools to approach their own work with an expanded understanding of artistic possibility.

The point of this two-unit seminar is to research and discuss how these issues relate to our work in interaction design and digital media production and to determine how the ITP community can have the most positive impact. In order to limit the scope of our research to something manageable within the semester, we focus mainly on environmental issues, starting with these central questions: What can we change here and now? What impact do our practices have on the environment, and what changes can we make to lessen the damage we do and increase any positive effects our work has? What skills or ideas do we bring to the table that can have the best effect? What are the most important things for a long-range sustainability program at ITP to focus on? In looking for answers to these questions, we attempt to address both our practice here at ITP and the assumptions we take with us into work and life after ITP.

With digital technologies, one other constraint is our own ability to keep up with the ever-shifting tools that we use. Does this perpetual learning curve stifle our creative process? Or in contrast, can an abundance of technical know-how cloud a simple vision? The goal of this course is to make work that is fueled by the positive constraints (our audience, our vision) rather than the damaging ones (our lack of ability to know everything about the tools we use). Through weekly assignments, we draw ideas and production techniques from art, game design, music (sound art), cognitive science, and universal design toward an understanding of how to carry our initial ideas through a development process, without compromising quality and clarity of vision. For a final assignment, students are asked to create a project for a specific target audience, defined by age/gender/race/culture and ability. The goal is to allow oneself a space for exploration while working toward a focused result. Some ideas for projects may include simplifying an application for the growing elderly population (can grandmama really use that fancy Nokia phone?), a software game based solely on audio (ever played Doom without a monitor in a dark room?), or an art piece that clearly conveys your artistic intentions with a digital medium (think of interactive art that's not utterly frustrating/annoying for gallery goers) In either case, we test our work early and often (starting midsemester), learn to identify problems, and solve them through an iterative design process. When needed, software examples are programmed using Processing. We also use simple pcomp modules to quicken exploration (such as custom keyboard emulators). A fair understanding of ICM and pcomp is required, as you are asked not to spend the majority of your energy learning new technologies, but rather make the best of what you already know. That's one of the course constraints.",

    "description": "Rapid prototyping and personal fabrication increasingly open possibilities of production that will reinvent our understanding and relationship with everyday objects and material culture. The seminar functions as both an introduction to different CNC prototyping equipment as well as a studio in which to test the possibilities and constraints of these new methods of production Using 3D printing, laser cutting, and milling, we develop a language of \"making\" that can be brought to bear on two different scales: product and display wall. The seminar works within various scripting and modeling environments as a means to both work with form and translate form into real-world artifacts. Rather than take the world of objects at face value, we seek to develop transferable ways of working with form to actively question the shape and usage of mass-produced objects. As a starting point, we break down the world of \"making\" into certain procedures (i.e., perforating, extruding, folding) and extend the potential within each in a simple three dimensional piece, a \"monad\"-or indivisible unit. This language, as well as the qualities that emerge from the physical model, is then questioned in its correlation to existing objects. After developing an extremely acute formal language within this procedure, the student is challenged to pair it with a means of accumulation/assemblage (i.e., stacking, gluing, tabbing, nesting) that can negotiate a scale-shift from product scale to a display wall. We wish to emphasize the relation to the idea of algorithmic development (i.e., a simple unit that is \"grown\" or repetitively made) is partially brought about through the simplistic operation of CNC prototyping equipment in the sense that they incrementally cut, deposit, or remove material. We do not focus on the \"natural\" or \"biomorphic\" aspects of this, but rather look at how these operations are deployed in objects all around us. The question is how an increased sophistication of design can be gained from the loosened constraints of mass standardization that these machines afford.",

If you open a copy of Word and create a file, it isn't “user-generated content.” If Stephen King opens Word and writes a book, that isn't it either. Somehow your local file doesn't count, while it isn't a surprise that Mr. King's novel finds readers.

Can one be moved to action, to tears, to laughter in a short time and small space? Can one possibly feel immersed? 2X2 is an experiment creative storytelling/narrative course exploring a potential new art form, specifically designed to be seen on a small (+/- 2 inches) screen for a short time (+/- 2 minutes).

Students are encouraged to imagine the impossible and to integrate metaforms into the contemporary city. Science fiction sites, transportation paths, urban anomalies, invisible boundaries, and temporary autonomous zone are examined and developed as metaform habitats. The semester long project is divided into two parts: expressions and interventions. The first section, expressions, addresses contemporary architectural tendencies that unfold to inhabit the spaces of urban environments. The second part, interventions, activates communication strategies to connect the metaforms to actual public spaces within New York City. The class work culminates in final presentations critiqued by guest reviewers from related fields. No prerequisites or architectural experience is needed, however, previous knowledge of at least one programming language is strongly recommended (Processing, MaxMSP/Jitter, Maya, Flash etc.).

Students explore drawing in whatever medium they choose, it need not be technological the idea is to generate a \"working tool set.\" This could mean exploring a certain aspect of MaxMSP or Processing or Arduino for example. The point is that drawing is an oddly physical and intellectual activity-one can't have one without the other. Can we bring some of this \"physicalness\" into how we understand our technological tools? Also, can we begin thinking about the sketchbook as a \"machine for ideas?\" The course is as much about \"drawing machines\" as it is about developing/refining a creative process.

When I finally recycle those old cell phones and computers that have been collecting dust in my closet, where will they be taken, and will anything or anyone be harmed as they are recycled? Without answers to these questions that people are seeking, there are limits to the role consumption can play in our shift to a more sustainable economic model. As product developers, designers, tinkerers, and technologists, we have the means to uncover these answers, and communicate the backstories of the things that we make. The objective of this course is to explore sustainable models, methods, and practices of both production and consumption. The class explores an interaction design model proposed by Bruce Sterling's Shaping Things, in which he implores, \"Designers must design, not just for objects or for people, but for the technosocial interactions that unite people and objects.\" Additional content exposes students to the relationship between production, consumption, and impacts to the earth's ecosystem and human health. Students learn how to analyze product/service systems and are expected to perform a Life Cycle Analysis based on the Okala Design framework. Students also are asked to investigate and communicate a product backstory to an existing product. The final exercise of the course involves the creation of a new product/service system that provides a framework for users to affect and modulate the environmental and social impacts throughout their relationship with that object.

Claude Levi-Strauss' observation that \"animals are good to think\" is the starting point from which we make, discuss, and examine the ways in which works of art imagine the interrelationships between the human, the animal, and our environment. If we can only perceive these things through mediation (media representations), then how we represent them is the fundamental question, reflecting our ideologies, prejudices, hopes, and fears. Do we speak for animals, and if so what are we saying for them? Are they friends, pets, environmental equals, or beasts? How are hybrid monsters (chimera) created and what do they mean? How do we understand our places as subjects in a landscape or a datascape? How can anthropomorphic cuteness be subversive? This course focuses on questions of intention, relation, and subjectivity, through critical engagement with representations of people, animals, monsters, and mutants, in their respective environments. The class is further focused on the use of character in context, via toy design, robotics, animation, video, image generation, or data visualization. There are introductory texts on character development, and generally an emphasis on literary, philosophical, and natural history texts, including Jorge Luis Borges, John Berger, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway, Rebecca Solnit, Steve Baker, Deleuze, and Guattari. Assignments include studio work and readings. There is more emphasis on the development and analysis of ideas, and less emphasis on particular media or forms.

Even as our technologies become smaller and more versatile, we find ourselves bending down towards our keyboards and screens, and much of what we communicate with our bodies gets lost in translation. In Thinking Physically, we work to open ourselves back up and embrace the rich capabilities and inherent expressiveness of the human form. Starting with the body itself, we think about how it works and take a brief look at motion studies and biomechanics. Next, we examine how we use our bodies to relate to each other, considering physical social perceptions, proxemics, and cultural contexts. We then work to become better listeners, striving to sense the subtleties of body language, gesture, and nonverbal communication. Finally, it's time to put those listening skills to work, designing interfaces that perceive the body's communicative nature and encourage people to interact in a more physical way. Thinking Physically is a hands-on workshop in which we get up and move. Students create experiments and prototypes (both conceptual and technical) in response to weekly topics and design a body-centric final project based on what they've learned. Curated uses of the body (dance, physical comedy, sports, etc.), act as inspiration, but students focus on the everyman as the target user for the projects they create. With a tool box of sensors, wearable techniques, and rugged interfaces in hand, we capture and provoke full-bodied expression.

This course takes an analytical approach to unraveling and understanding these charged moments. In the process of the studying how and why strangers interact in public, we address some of the abiding themes at ITP urban behavior, spontaneous interaction, the pleasure of the unexpected, how technology can mediate and/or enable human experience and we make a close and thorough examination of how they play out in this narrow slice of human experience. This approach is designed to bring students to a more concrete understanding of these larger abstract ideas. Classwork consists of readings, class discussions, field assignments (a series of assigned interactions with strangers that the students document and discuss) and an analytical final paper. Students learn how the interactions of strangers have changed historically (and why), what the experience of interaction with strangers means to the participants, how strangers ‘read’ each other, how they initiate interactions, how they avoid interactions, how they trust each other and how they fool each other. Readings range from seminal works on urban sociology and public behavior (Georg Simmel, Stanley Milgram, Erving Goffman, Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Elijah Anderson) to more lyrical examinations of strangers in cities (Tim Etchells, Italo Calvino, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Edgar Allan Poe) to recent neuropsychiatric discoveries about trust, mimicry, and flash judgments. Because stranger interactions are at heart a means to interrupt the expected narrative of the everyday, we consider the works of artists and thinkers who show how such disruption, surprise, spontaneity, and play are fundamental to the pleasure and substance of urban life, for example: the Situationists and their descendents, Sophie Calle, Marina Abramovic, Francis Alys, Graffiti Research Lab, Robert Rauschenberg, Survival Research Labs. We also explore recent art/technology projects that specifically engage strangers, such as Familiar Strangers, the Listening Station, PostSecret, Oddible, Loca: Set to Discoverable, Following the Man in the Crowd, Mobile Feelings, and others.",

Furthermore, we examine the power of persuasive technologies in creating opportunities for communicating nonhuman intentions and viewpoints. Readings range from Douglas Adams on Genuine People Personalities, to Frank Herbert's Without Me, You're Nothing, Friedrich Juenger's The Failure of Technology, to BJ Fogg, Nass, and Rives, and the work in Critical Design by Dunne and Raby, among others. Through class discussion, readings and examples we identify human emotional/social touchpoints: jealousy, seduction, fear, risk, reward, etc. Students conduct their own analyses of a manipulation technique, and of its corresponding persuasive technology application. For the second assignment students develop and present a persuasive technology concept for a nonhuman object or viewpoint.

Students gain a studied and nuanced understanding of the idea of intimacy and the physical and emotional experiences associated with as well as examining how existing and cutting-edge technologies work to connect intimates across the physical and metaphorical distances they routinely experience in everyday life. The first section of the course is devoted to studying intimacy, bonding, attachment, longing and desire from a variety of perspectives. These include psychology and psychoanalysis-e.g. Freud, Erich Fromm, Lacan, Kristeva, John Bowlby on attachment, Jessica Benjamin on bonding, Donald Winnicott on intersubjectivity; recent neuroscience, neurochemistry, and evolutionary biology related to intimacy and bonding; and recent psychological work specifically regarding intimacy and the internet. The second section of the course focuses on current art and technology projects-along with commercial ventures-that explore mediated intimacy across distances (the examples are legion). We scrutinize these projects to understand what they do right and what they do wrong. And we investigate the language and syntax of mediated intimacy, including attempts to incorporate each of (or combinations of) the human senses into devices of connectedness. In seeking to articulate what makes a meaningful mediated experience of intimacy, the course also looks at a group of edge cases-for example, personal performances in public (from web-cam girls to performance support asymmetrical intimacies.

    "description": "Biological organisms and systems are essentially living machines. Digital technologies allow us to create a control structure with computational predictability and precision. What happens, however, when designers begin to incorporate the self-determined internal control structure of a biological system as part of a design strategy? This course offers a new approach to materiality, positing that all matter is dynamic but exists within a continuum of control ranging from passively temporal (wood, water) to electronically active (photovoltaics, thermochromics) to biologically alive (plants, tissue). This course presents alternative design strategies for creating computational interfacing with living matter and state change of natural materials. Students are introduced to the world of the bio lab from a designer's perspective, both conceptually and practically. We examine the state-of-the-art in artistic experimentation with biological systems such as the genetic manipulation projects of Eduardo Kac, or the carbon nanotubes grown into architectural structures of Ryan Wartena. We also examine more DIY approaches to living systems integration and interactivity with biological systems. Students use a hands-on approach in their design process, with biological sensing as input and indicators or material state change as an alternative method of information display, for example. This course is designed to further our computational relationship with the natural world pushing forward ideas in sustainability, interactivity, energy production and the emerging relationship between the designer/artist and the bio lab, approaching biology as an open frontier for digital design.",

This course will investigate how others are answering that question right now, using specific political and technological toolsets. From the Iranian \"Twitter revolution\" in Azadi square to Sri Lankan bloggers, from post-election Kenyan crowdsourcing to the grassroots humanitarian Katrina response, to the Obama election, this class will investigate technologies created or re-purposed for socio-political change. What are the design and implementation issues? If we view government as a “platform,” what does that mean for new interfaces? Are all governments a stable compilation? If not, what are the implications for interaction design? Is there any way to avoid bias in application design? How do we accommodate for those with whom we do not agree? How should transparency and security issues be properly balanced when these issues are translated in applications? What are the real tools that have been used or are being used right now to rectify injustice and bring positive social change? What have been their advantages and disadvantages, and how has political context defined their use? How does the digital divide modify the outcome? Together in this class we will look at live global case studies to answer these questions, from the viewpoint of the individual user of both government and technology. We will review underlying design issues around freedom of information and privacy, structured change vs. creative chaos, crisis-driven vs. long-term change, and strength in numbers vs. the value of dissent, all with an eye towards producing good new ideas for positive social change. You will be asked to select one case study to follow through the semester, be given readings and outside speakers will be invited to present issues. You will present your case study findings and will be expected to integrate your findings into your final assignment: one prototype for potential or actual implementation Rather than learning about specific tools (this is not a production or design class), this class is about understanding a user scenario.

How do you hide the equipment in nesting places, feeding places, and other regularly visited spots? Can you attach tracking radios to the animals themselves without causing them hardship? How do you \"ruggedize\" the equipment? How do you gather data from the equipment you've placed regularly and reliably? These challenges are related to common interaction design problems with humans, so understanding and mastering them is valuable experience for interaction designers. For anthropologists, zoological, and veterinary researchers, understanding the technologies behind their tracking equipment, and the approach that technology designers take in developing and deploying these tools can benefit their research. The goal of this class is to give students an introduction to the technological challenges of tracking and observation of wildlife Specifically, students are presented with the challenges faced by Professor Anthony Di Fiore's research group in tracking spider monkeys in Ecuador. Students discuss the challenges associated with spider monkey research, survey the state of the art in animal tracking with a focus on appropriate tools for this research project, and work in groups to develop interactive prototypes to address one or more of these challenges. Our hope is that this class serves both to introduce students to the subject, and also develop some workable prototypes that could be developed further in future semesters, either through other research projects related to this particular work, or on their own. In order to realize the goals of this class, students have access to current tracking tools: radio collars, “ruggedized” cameras, microphones, and other current tracking technologies. We also introduce common sensor and communication technologies used in physical interaction design practice.

This is an experimental class to first explore different ways we might read poetry, using published work of modern or traditional poets. Students are encouraged to use media that they are most comfortable with-animation, video, processing, etc. There are writing exercises based on the poems we use in class. Through this work we explore what makes a poem a poem. It's not necessarily rhyme or meter, but there are underlying structures and guidelines: the use of tension, stresses; how and where a poem ‘turns’ to deliver an inevitable surprise; what is left unsaid, that a poem does not explain...and more. Students begin to explore different ways to write poetry. thinking of it perhaps not so much as a reading or even spoken experience, but maybe as something else. Who knows?

How can sound effect the way people engage and perceive public space? Aside from an examination of the physical attributes of sound itself, this first section involves presentations and research into the histories sound art and sound design within the contexts of urban environments. With this in mind, this research is directed towards the second phase of the course: the production of a sound- based work that is to be proposed for public space in New York. Emphasis is given to situating sound both spatially and temporally, understanding the work in terms of site specificity as well as its location within the larger discourses and histories of sound, design and urbanism. Technical prerequisites are basic sound programs such as Audacity or any basic knowledge of some form of sound-making tools. Course examples may be given using Max/MSP, Processing, Logic, physical computing etc., but only to illustrate concept. The focus is on the content and context of the works, and participants are responsible for defining the best tools for the deployment of their ideas. Final works are presented as working prototypes/designs or full deployments of the sound interventions. This studio includes a midterm concept critique and final critique by guest architects, artists, designers and sound designers.",

Overall, we learn strategies for creating richer and more subtle technology projects that ask users or participants for their contingent acceptance of the project's reality. Coursework includes weekly readings, field experiments, and short papers. The semester is split into two overarching themes - the first is Humanness. When we attribute human-esque responsiveness or behavioral and emotional characteristics to a non-human, what cognitive processes are we engaging? What are some of the most persuasive signals of humanness, signals that are powerful enough to convey humanness even in the absence of other cues? Topics and readings include: * Establishing a working definition of authenticity; * The uncanny (Freud); * Theory of mind, intuition, empathy (Selections from The Missing Link in Cognition, on primates); * Dead or Alive (Mary Shelley, Frankenstein; other monsters) * Projection: animism & anthropomorphizing (Sherry Turkle, Pascal Boyer); * Responsive machines (various studies of social and humanoid robots). The second is Identities and environments. What is authenticity of person or of place? By what cues do we attribute authenticity to individual identities and constructed environments? How many or few cues does it take for us to read a system, a person, a constructed world as authentic? What lessons for technology makers are to be learned by investigating abnormal psychology, world-building, and manipulated truth/trust? Topics and readings include: * Broken perception-delusions of false worlds (selections on misidentification syndromes, e.g Cotard's, Fregoli delusion, reduplicative paramnesia, Capgras); * Unreality in unreal systems/environments (Coraline, Metal Snake/Psycho Mantis [game], Philip K. Dick's Ubiq); * Historical hoaxes (case studies including Piltdown Man, Barnum's Feejee Mermaid, the original Mechanical Turk); Imposters (case studies including Kaycee Nicole, lg15, Our First Time, Frederic Bourdin, Martin Guerre); * The long con (selections fromThe Big Con and case studies of internet-based cons, e.g. 419s and other pigeon drop cons).",

The class combines seminars, field work and prototyping. The primary textbook of this class is the natural world and 3.5 billion years of iterative design evolution. Primary investigations begin with the study and design of systems that mimic the closed-loop processes of micro and macro ecologies, the super efficient and symbiotic methods that harness solar energy in an infinitely regenerative cycle, recirculating matter and energy between plants and animals in symbiosis to produce an abundance of food and energy with zero waste. In thinking about how we will feed ourselves in the 21st century, and how urban centers will re-engage with the natural world, we are drawing inspiration from these primal forces and organizing principles. Explorations focus on combining botany, horticulture, agriculture, design, sensing, feedback mechanisms and clean technologies to create living systems that support health and well-being, clean air, water, plants, energy and food. A primary investigation will be designing future systems of farming and food production, particularly in the urban context, including high-intensity building-integrated agricultural techniques such as hydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics. There is also a focus on restorative ecosystem services in urban planning and design, and the interface between phyto systems and human systems.

While ICM projects are done in the Processing development environment, the work in this class will be done in Eclipse, a more advanced environment (IDE), allowing the class to write better code faster. In Eclipse, students will learn how to use the Processing libraries in Java. Next, the class will focus on core programming techniques such as Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures. We also will cover how to collect data from APIs. In doing so we will compare XML and JSON, as well as how best to organize and store that data in programs. Finally we deal with encapsulation, a method for structuring programs so that complex problems can be made manageable by breaking them down into small reusable parts. ICM or equivalent is required. This two unit class meets every other week.",

As students become more familiar with loading, extracting, and manipulating data visually, they will be gradually exposed to a variety of techniques and methods for different types of data visualization with the goal of developing narratives around their discoveries. A real-world example created by the instructors will be used occasionally to demonstrate various aspects of the design and development process. Ultimate success in this course is a final project that reflects an understanding of how to create an experience that addresses (answers, creates, develops) a rich question or narrative based on actual data. There will be several guest speakers and critics including artists, journalists, government analysts and those from other disciplines. Basic programming experience is required.

A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. This change in the economics of communication has opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several profound effects in the media landscape today. This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries - newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking - faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere. This course covers the history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation from weblogs and wikis and Twitter to fan fiction and lolcats.

Reading social weather is a basic human skill. Social software—software used for group communications— also has social weather, but it is much harder to read. The culture and behavior of online groups is not as readily apparent as it is in a real room, for several reasons, including limited interfaces, separation of the participants in space and time, and lack of contextual clues. Social Weather examines how we read the mood and feeling of online spaces and the ways software affects the social weather (and vice versa).

The technique has been used since the mid-1950s decades to distinguish certainties from uncertainties, and to learn to be prepared for multiple eventualities. Students will conduct original research on significant trends, use those trends to develop compelling, plausible stories about possible futures, and present the futures—and the strategies they suggest—to a public audience. As part of the process that we co-develop, the class explores theories about system dynamics, organizational and societal change, the causes of economic failure and success, and the nature of technology.",

    "description": "Networks exist in the spaces between things; they require both concrete entities (computers, people, businesses) and abstract relations (protocols, friendships, contracts). We understand intuitively that networked computers differ from stand-alone computers, or that a group of friends differs from an aggregation of anonymous individuals, but describing that difference clearly is difficult. In particular, networks exhibit emergent characteristics that cannot be explained simply by examining their constituent parts. People are not like computers, but networks of people and networks of computers are alike in many ways. It is the organization of the respective networks that creates those similarities. Network Effects is a course about the structure of networks and how that structure affects human experience. We focus in particular on two invisible networks— communications networks and social networks. Communications networks are invisible in the traditional sense; their inner workings are hidden from us. We examine a variety of communications networks and explore the ways different networks affect the experiences of their users. Social networks are invisible in a different way; because we are so immersed in myriad social networks—friends, family, work, school—we don’t see them. We examine some of the structural elements of social networks, such as strong and weak ties, clustering, and small-worlds networks, to understand some of the ways that the shape of social networks affects us. The goal of the course is to synthesize observations about these two types of networks. Technological choices embodied in electronic networks profoundly affect their social dimensions: Why can we CC people on email but not on phone calls? How does the one-way network of television differ from the two-way network of the Internet? What effect does BitTorrent’s architectural decentralization have on its users? Social choices also affect the design of technology; resistance to spamming or attempts to hide from the RIAA have led to several deep technological changes in the design of blogs and file-sharing networks, respectively, changes that alter the social relations among the users. The class meetings center on discussion of readings and lectures. Outside class, students complete two short papers, a midterm project, and a final paper or project. The midterm project involves designing and implementing a small network (though not necessarily a computer- mediated one) and describing its effects. The final is a project or research interest of the student’s choice and involves designing, building, and describing a network; a visual and descriptive analysis of an existing network; or a research paper.",

    "description": "In an ordinary conversation, a person’s body language registers as much as his or her spoken language. When a computer or a computer network mediates the conversation, the context is usually filtered out leaving only the text to be conveyed. This course looks at techniques for conveying a fuller range of expression over the Internet. Students begin by programming simple chat servers and work toward building tools for transmitting video. Along the way, they learn techniques for making synchronous TCP and UDP, connections, formatting, compressing and parsing data, client/server and peer-to-peer architectures, connecting with physical computing devices, and real-time analysis and synthesis of video images. Another goal of this course is for students to learn to program using Java. Java basics are covered “as needed” for the specific networking techniques covered. This is more of a “by example” course than a comprehensive introduction to Java. The course does not require any previous Java programming experience. It is also fine for students to substitute languages that they already know, like Director or Flash, for some client interfaces.",

    "description": "What does “designing experience” mean? It is an act of choreographing a series of events in the others’ mind. How is it different from, for example, making a movie? In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and “spoon-fed” to the audience (at least on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product’s functionality/experience. Here, the user’s experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This course explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, students redesign an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, they design a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality. Students are encouraged to explore new 2 vocabulary of interactivity, to expand the lexicon of interactive experience, and to examine the societal role of designing experience.",

It constitutes the most intimate form of making and is the testing ground for new thoughts. “Drawing without ego” means letting go of fears of what you think drawing should be, and just letting it happen—feeling comfortable enough to use drawing as an alphabet to build thoughts visually, like language is built from letters. The course encourages the student to experiment and develop a visual idea, more than to create finished work. Assignments include sketching out proposals for new work—storyboarding, for example—building a visual vocabulary through various forms of improvisation, as well as the more conventional practice of drawing from the model and still life. Students bring their knowledge of interactive telecommunications to drawing and find ways to let drawing enter into their design work. In this introductory drawing class students are urged to draw anything they want, exploring the freedom of expression that comes from playing with one’s imagination and memory and creating convincing imagery with or without references. The class will have informal critiques, and will visit galleries to look at contemporary art. Weekly assignments are required.

The radical change social software brings about is the decoupling of groups in space and time. Realworld conversations require everyone to be in the same place at the same moment; by undoing those restrictions, the Internet has ushered in a host of new social patterns, from the mailing list to the chat room to the blog. Designing such software is a problem that cannot be attacked in the same way as designing a word processor; designers of social software have more in common with economists or political scientists than they do with designers of single-user software, and operators of communal resources have more in common with politicians or landlords than with operators of ordinary Web sites. This course is based on the premise that we have only begun to figure out ways to support these new social patterns. The course begins with an overview of the 40-year history of social software and moves quickly to an examination of the tools and techniques available today, from blogs and wikis to RSS feeds and connectivity through Wi-Fi.

    "description": "If you were inventing a museum today, what would it look like? Who would be there? What would its main purpose be? Before you answer that question, let’s take a look back. The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside—amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go. The public was very limited; children were usually not allowed in. They were elitist institutions whose mission was archiving the past. Today, although most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors, there are fundamental ways—attitudes, techniques, structural issues—that are still lodged in the 19th century. Now, because of a very different kind of Cabinet of Wonder, i.e., the computer and other IT technologies, museums are able to display collections, demonstrate concepts, and reach their audiences in new ways. Most have not taken full advantage of these new tools or had the time to explore how they might change the nature of a museum visit, but we do in this course. We document together the ways in which technology may enhance the museum experience. We evaluate the use of interactive technologies in museums and how that experience might be extended online. But first we observe and study what they do now. We cannot invent a new wheel before we understand the old one. In this course, we explore the different kinds of exhibits in museums (object-based collection, demonstrations of phenomena), historic or single topic museums (e.g., the Tenement Museum), and the varied kinds of venues for exhibits (museums, trade shows, traveling, nature centers). Students learn through experience and discussion a brief history of museums and exhibitions and discover criteria for informal learning environments that differ from schoolroom learning. This course is an exploration, observation, and theory course. You are asked to visit specific museums: an iconic one of each type. These visits are your primary assignments— sometimes accompanied by a reading. A guest speaker from the assigned museum makes an in-class presentation and receives critiques from you. In the second half of the course, we begin to reinvent the museum. What is its purpose in the 21st century? How does the need for a curator change? We look at different museums’ efforts to use technology to take museums beyond the walls, to expand the notion of curators, to include people who don’t have access, or don’t know they do, to the places. And though we focus on museums, we also look at exhibits and other public displays of information. This is not a design or production course. The assignments are field trips to museums, readings, and writing. The course is primarily discussion- based, and class participation is a major part of the grade.",

Over the course of the class, the focus of each student is on a particular area of science and the aim is to become familiar with its process, language, and data. To do this, students get firsthand experience unpacking particular visualizations, by talking with scientists and students of scientific disciplines, and by interviewing members of potential audiences. Who produces and analyses data, and what are they looking for in their results? Who else is interested in understanding data—and in what setting, through what medium or interface? From these direct experiences, students propose their own art/science collisions: using artistic sensibilities and media tools to communicate about the scientific process, contextualize and annotate visualizations, and frame the chosen topic for particular audiences: museumgoers, policy makers, the disabled, teachers, adults, or children. In periodic “science salons,” students discuss their chosen areas of science, associated datasets and visualizations, affiliated scientists, and potential audiences.

Techniques covered in the course are geared toward social and location-aware applications, though the class experiments with parsing incoming photo messages, translating semacodes, using geocoders and proximity algorithms, and more. The course focuses heavily on building applications that work on “lowest-common denominator” phones, though students are encouraged to find examples of applications that use emerging technologies (Java and Bluetooth) and discover ways to retrofit these applications to work with the phones we carry in our pockets today. This is not a course on Java/J2ME or Bluetooth development. Students are expected to build at least two working applications during the semester (midterm plus final).",

Students first study the fundamentals of persuasion, influence, and coercion and then look at how they have been adapted for use in interactive contexts. These include e-mail, the Web, and cell phones, as well as integrated marketing, “one-to-one” communication, viral media, hacktivism, and neuromarketing. Students study a broad range of applications, from simple marketing through online trading, political campaigns, activism, and satire, and discuss the relative ethics of using the same techniques for different purposes. How do Web sites guide users toward the “buy” button? How are viral campaigns launched? How do PowerPoint and Microsoft “spell-check” influence our thought patterns? How do marketers exploit information to craft persuasive messaging? How does the use of manipulative communications techniques change the quality of the media landscape? How do today’s online selling techniques fit into a history of salesmanship and marketing? How do wireless companies hope to get ads on our cell phones? Is the interactive space more or less conducive to manipulative communications? Readings include whole books and excerpts from among the following texts: Coercion and Media Virus by Rushkoff, Postman’s Technopoly, Cluetrain Manifesto, Lencker’s Train of Thoughts, and The CIA Interrogation Manual, as well as writings by Adorno, Barbrook, Harold Innes, Caldini, Benjamin, Naomi Klein, David Byrne, Tufte, Larry Lessig, Seth Godin, Malcolm Gladwell, Sergio Zyman, MoveOn, RtMark, and etoy, and articles from magazines including Fast Company and Wired. Screenings may include the documentaries Merchants of Cool, The Persuaders, and the Politics of Fear. Students gain experience in researching, analyzing, and deconstructing existing interactive media and software for its persuasive impact. Although students with all ranges of interests are welcome to take the course, be forewarned: the seminar is structured to allow for a highly critical analysis of the role that marketing and influence techniques have played in both online and offline society.",

    "description": "The world abounds with social facts, things that are true because society has decided to behave as if they are true. If you were to turn to a fellow student and say, “I do” or “I sentence you to five years in prison,” your listener would not become your spouse or be hustled off to Rikers. Nothing happens during a wedding or a sentencing hearing; those events are just special forms of talking. Yet talking, in those circumstances, creates real change in the world. There are two nested effects here—the inner one is the conditions under which speech becomes action, and the outer one is the ways we give groups the power to enforce those actions. Social software creates novel contexts for groups, but currently operates outside traditional social support for group action. For example, both corporations and online groups can have high degrees of internal cohesion and strive for external effects on the world, but corporations have the blessing of society, as an official “legal fiction,” to take actions that ordinary groups, no matter how cohesive, are forbidden to take. That gap is mainly one of tradition—one can readily imagine alternate “legal fictions” to support alternate kinds of groups. This course is centered around weekly readings and class discussions of primary materials, some historical, some current, revolving around four questions: What effect does social software have on groups who want to take action in the world? How do groups come to binding decisions about the action they want to take? What are the traditional supports and constraints for real-world groups (corporations, governments, NGOs, etc.) that act on the world? And what new forms of social support can we imagine for groups that are mainly or solely organized online? The course features readings from political and economic theory of group action, the social structure of engaged (as opposed to merely conversational) groups, and field observations of real world groups using social software. Students are expected to keep a weekly journal, to write midterm and final papers on groups trying to use social software to effect real change in the world. Note: This course is politically neutral. The design issues discussed are relevant to both liberal and conservative political actors. Students interested in taking this course should be comfortable entertaining political ideas they disagree with personally.",

Our goal is to expand the palette of interaction design to more fully engage our sensory apparatus. A particular focus is on the aesthetic possibilities of such multisensory design. We look at our senses in various combinations, examining how they closely interact and relate with one another. While smell and taste may not necessarily be directly evoked, it is possible to inspire these through a curious combination of audiovisual and tactile stimuli.

The course begins with a review of the electronics of sensor systems as learned in physical computing. From there, students discuss types of sensors; sensors, time, and events; amplification and filtering of sensor signals; sensor networks; and related topics that aid in making sensor systems effective. There are a number of one-week exercises that students complete to demonstrate the techniques discussed in class. In addition, students are responsible for a major sensor research project in which they explain the operating principles of a given sensor and present a working example of the sensor in use. These research projects are presented throughout the second half of the semester and collected into an online reference site.

How can one remain in control of one’s identity in that future? This course creates a framework to help students not only analyze existing technology, but also to help them think more deeply about their own projects. Students review current technologies such as Internet protocols, cellular networks, and RFID; they also get hands-on experience in both using these technologies and hacking them. We all understand why you shouldn’t throw out a credit card receipt with the card’s number on it without tearing it up, but should we be concerned with clicking on a link on a Web page? Sending an instant message? Opening a laptop to sign onto the wireless network at Starbucks? Maybe. Clicking on a Web page records your IP address on a Web server somewhere, instant messages are usually sent off unencrypted over the network, and opening a laptop usually requires negotiation with a DHCP server that records your computer’s unique identifier. Our devices and our online interactions leave a mark as unique as our fingerprints; thus, relevant questions are how can we turn those tables? What technologies can we create to trace information left by others? Given that openness is a core feature of the networks and technologies we use, what code, regulations, and etiquette make these usable?

As a sensor the video camera is appealing, delivering up to 36 million bytes every second compared to maybe three bytes from a keyboard. Accessories and knowledge for using cameras are mainstream. For instance, by simply changing lenses, the same sensor once used for your fingers can now be aimed at a city block. Even very inexpensive computers are now fast enough to not only record frames of video but also to look through the individual pixels. It is no wonder cameras have become a standard accessory for computers (especially in cell phones). The difficulty of computer vision comes when you expect your software to be able to mimic the powers of the human brain to interpret arbitrary images. This course attempts to sidestep the difficult parts if you are willing to work in fairly contrived environments such as art installations, eye tracking rigs, or ant farms. The course covers software techniques for tracking objects in video, background removal, blob detection, as well as tricks on the optical side of the equation. Video tracking in real time requires a coding parsimony that can be used as a challenging method to improve a student’s overall coding skills. The course uses Java in the Eclipse environment, which is a good next step from the Processing environment.

Interactivity, the passage of time, and resolution are just a few of the ideas that are being explored. Yet these ideas are new only in the sense that they are being adapted to new media. For example, in painting and sculpture, Renaissance and baroque artists used a variety of means to actively engage the viewer; the concept of continuous narrative, reaching back to the Egyptians, aims to convey the passage of time; and the notion of resolution has been variously interpreted by Titian, Seurat, Cézanne, de Kooning, Close, and many others. This course examines how artists throughout history have utilized various media and techniques to effect formal, conceptual, and experiential dynamics comparable to those being investigated by new media artists today. The goal of the course is not only to provide students with knowledge of the immensely rich history of artistic creativity, but also—and more important—to provide a platform through which that knowledge may be utilized to reconsider new media strategies of artistic expression. Through observation, discussion, reading, and projects (both written and hands-on), students acquire mental tools to approach their own work with an expanded understanding of artistic possibility. This course is not a dry art history survey and is not conducted as such. Organized thematically, rather than chronologically, the focus of each class is on a different concept derived from the field of new media production and examined with regard to artistic precedents. This is a course that necessitates active participation on the part of all students.",

At some point you are going to have to pitch your projects to people outside ITP, and this studio helps you gain the skills you will need. This studio is a complement to a production class. Each student brings a project from another class; we take the time, often lacking in class, to learn how to focus an idea into a workable concept and to practice and experiment with ways to present it. Writing is critical to thinking and design—so the writing you do helps you hone and clarify your concept and lay the basis for a smoother, more effective design and development process. We work on the structure of presentations, public speaking techniques, and how to write and design engaging and memorable presentations. We also work on written communication, which may include grant writing, artist’s statements, and proposals.",

    "description": "The term “sustainability” has been applied to a wide range of issues since the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Earth Summit). These issues fall roughly into three categories: environment and ecology, economic development, and human rights equity. There are massive changes needed in all of these areas. The point of this two-unit seminar is to research and discuss how these issues relate to our work in interaction design and digital media production and to determine how the ITP community can have the most positive impact. In order to limit the scope of our research to something manageable within the semester, we focus mainly on environmental issues, starting with these central questions: What can we change here and now? What impact do our practices have on the environment, and what changes can we make to lessen the damage we do and increase any positive effects our work has? What skills or ideas do we bring to the table that can have the best effect? What are the most important things for a long-range sustainability program at ITP to focus on? In looking for answers to these questions, we attempt to address both our practice here at ITP and the assumptions we take with us into work and life after ITP. We build an online resource for ourselves and others based on what we learn in the process. This might include reading lists, suggested actions to be taken, links to sources of useful materials and tools for designers and artists, and to organizations whose work overlaps ours. We implement what changes we can and make suggestions on those that will take longer. For several of the class meetings, guest practitioners from a variety of areas join the class to discuss how their work is affected by these issues. The class is broken into groups of four, and each group is expected to research a given guest’s work and prepare to lead the class conversation with the guest. Students are expected to read and research widely on the issues addressed in the class, report on their findings, participate actively in discussions in class and online, and to begin to take action in their own projects.",

This course covers a broad selection of technical subjects concerning Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) including advanced JavaScript, DOM manipulation, Google Maps API, XSLT, JSON, RPC, XMLHttpRequest, and the various available AJAX frameworks (GWT, Prototype, Dojo, jQuery, etc.) Students are expected to be proficient in at least one other programming language. There are small exercises assigned for each class to ensure that the techniques are understood and mastered. Students are encouraged to either build a small project or to incorporate their new knowledge into projects from other courses such as Dynamic Web Development. In full, the course covers enough information for the student to build their own Google Maps yet retain a conceptual framework that can be applied in designing anything from the next best Web 2.0 service to the most radical net-art happening since Jodi hijacked Netscape.",

    "description": "Whether we design an application for the small touch pad of a cell phone, a game for an elderly user, or produce art through a self-defined conviction, our work is often driven by constraints— some chosen, others imposed. With digital technologies, one other constraint is our own ability to keep up with the ever-shifting tools that we use. Does this perpetual learning curve stifle our creative process? Or in contrast, can an abundance of technical know-how cloud a simple vision? The goal of this course is to make work that is fueled by the positive constraints (our audience, our vision) rather than the damaging ones (our lack of ability to know everything about the tools we use). Through weekly assignments, we draw ideas and production techniques from art, game design, music (sound art), cognitive science, and universal design toward an understanding of how to carry our initial ideas through a development process, without compromising quality and clarity of vision. For a final assignment, students are asked to create a project for a specific target audience, defined by age/gender/ race/culture and ability. The goal is to allow oneself a space for exploration while working toward a focused result. Some ideas for projects may include simplifying an application for the growing elderly population (can grandmama really use that fancy Nokia phone?), a software game based solely on audio (ever played Doom without a monitor in a dark room?), or an art piece that clearly conveys your artistic intentions with a digital medium (think of interactive art that’s not utterly frustrating/annoying for gallery goers). In either case, we test our work early and often (starting mid-semester), learn to identify problems, and solve them through an iterative design process. When needed, software examples are programmed using Processing. We also use simple pcomp modules to quicken exploration (such as custom keyboard emulators). A fair understanding of ICM and pcomp is required, as you are asked not to spend the majority of your energy learning new technologies, but rather make the best of what you already know. That’s one of the course constraints.",

    "description": "Rapid prototyping and personal fabrication increasingly open possibilities of production that will reinvent our understanding and relationship with everyday objects and material culture. The seminar functions as both an introduction to different CNC + prototyping equipment as well as a studio in which to test the possibilities and constraints of these new methods of production. Using 3D printing, laser cutting, and milling, we develop a language of “making” that can be brought to bear on two different scales: product and display wall. The seminar works within various scripting and modeling environments as a means to both work with form and translate form into real-world artifacts. Rather than take the world of objects at face value, we seek to develop transferable ways of working with form to actively question the shape and usage of mass-produced objects. As a starting point, we break down the world of “making” into certain procedures (i.e., perforating, extruding, folding) and extend the potential within each in a simple three dimensional piece, a “monad”—or indivisible unit. This language, as well as the qualities that emerge from the physical model, is then questioned in its correlation to existing objects. After developing an extremely acute formal language within this procedure, the student is challenged to pair it with a means of accumulation/assemblage (i.e., stacking, gluing, tabbing, nesting) that can negotiate a scale-shift from product scale to a display wall. We wish to emphasize the relation to the idea of algorithmic development (i.e., a simple unit that is “grown” or repetitively made) is partially brought about through the simplistic operation of CNC prototyping equipment in the sense that they incrementally cut, deposit, or remove material. We do not focus on the “natural” or “biomorphic” aspects of this, but rather look at how these operations are deployed in objects all around us. The question is how an increased sophistication of design can be gained from the loosened constraints of mass standardization that these machines afford.",

Whether you are working in the physical or the virtual public, frame and context are primary considerations in the work you produce. We look at contemporary art practices and texts that engage and critique the local and the global, invert locale and involve the everyday, as well as more traditional urban studies. We also extend the idea of “site” to include a variety of tactical media and works that fall under the rubric of relational aesthetics. Site Specific is a seminar that consists of readings, writing, critique, and presentation that focuses on art works—sculptural, architectural, and digital practices—that operate in the spheres of public spaces.

Somehow your local file doesn’t count, while it isn’t a surprise that Mr. King’s novel finds readers.

Now film is viewable on handheld devices (phones, palms, iPods, MP3 players), and people are watching movies on these devices that are meant for the big screen and a communal experience (theater), or they are watching short-format forms, such as commercials and music videos, which are meant for TV and whose purpose is selling stuff. Will a new art form emerge out of this? Will there be a new vocabulary? Will visuals become less important? Sound more important? Can one be moved to action, to tears, to laughter in a short time and small space? Can one possibly feel immersed? 2X2 is an experiment—a creative storytelling/ narrative course exploring a potential new art form, specifically designed to be seen on a small (+/- 2 inches) screen for a short time (+/- 2 minutes). Emphasis is on story, not production, not interaction, not theory. We explore narrative possibilities in both nonfiction (e.g., essay forms, minidocs) and fiction (e.g., stories, poetry, performance). In some assignments, students work with other people’s stories; in others, they create their own. In a collaboration created for this course, students have access to and permission to use the Magnum Photo archive (www.magnumphotos.com). The class follows a “creative writing” style format. Each week there are two assignments. These are quick sketches/rough drafts; a specific exercise is given at the end of each class, which has two aspects: a topic/theme (e.g., confess to an emotional crime), and a form restriction (e.g., use no words). In each class, students present their work for critique. Every week each student adds an episode, randomly assigned, to someone else’s story created the previous week. For a final project, each student picks two of their individual assignments (one fiction, one nonfiction) to take to a more finished level. The last class is a film festival with outside reviewers.",

Students explore drawing in whatever medium they choose, it need not be technological— the idea is to generate a “working tool set.” This could mean exploring a certain aspect of MaxMSP or Processing or Arduino for example. The point is that drawing is an oddly physical and intellectual activity—one can’t have one without the other. Can we bring some of this “physicalness” into how we understand our technological tools? Also, can we begin thinking about the sketchbook as a “machine for ideas?” The course is as much about “drawing machines” as it is about developing/refining a creative process.

During the course, students research the social issues related to their design challenge: why does this problem exist, how common is this situation, and how does individual design differ from inclusive or universal design? As projects progress students are asked to generalize their solutions and define how a larger population might use their designs. The goal of the course is to bring student designers together with people in the community who need a specific one-off working solution that is used by the individual and documented to share with similar organizations. The course requires introduction to physical computing and introduction to computational media.",

Non-Linear editors allow us to easily assemble sequential images on the frame level while image manipulation programs give us the power to change images on the pixel level. By using techniques from animation, special effects, video editing, and programming, we break images apart and reassemble them into new moving imagery. Our primary tool is Adobe After Effects but we also explore the algorithms behind image manipulation so that students might integrate the techniques into their own code. Student’s assignments can either be prerendered animation, or real- time interactive animation. Grades are based on weekly assignments, a midterm project, and a final project. Class participation and discussion are also required. No previous knowledge of After Effects is necessary, but students should be relatively comfortable with Photoshop. Experience with non-linear editing is a plus, but not required. Students must have completed either one animation course or one post-ICM programming course.",

The course follows a rigorous design methodology that teaches students how to go from idea to conceptual prototype. Students work in small project teams of three to five. Weekly classes are divided in two sections; the first to discuss topics relevant to emerging media design such as next generation user interface design, social media theory, open API development, mobile technologies, and multi-channel content distribution. Following each week’s topic, students are expected to present their project updates with open class discussion in the form of critique sessions. Students are expected to prototype a final project so prior experience with basic electronics, physical computing, Web programming, and prototyping software (Adobe Flash is helpful, but not required.) The final project requires a working prototype with supporting design documentation.

When I finally recycle those old cell phones and computers that have been collecting dust in my closet, where will they be taken, and will anything or anyone be harmed as they are recycled? Without answers to these questions that people are seeking, there are limits to the role consumption can play in our shift to a more sustainable economic model. As product developers, designers, tinkerers, and technologists, we have the means to uncover these answers, and communicate the backstories of the things that we make. The objective of this course is to explore sustainable models, methods, and practices of both production and consumption. The class explores an interaction design model proposed by Bruce Sterling’s Shaping Things, in which he implores, “Designers must design, not just for objects or for people, but for the techno-social interactions that unite people and objects.” Additional content exposes students to the relationship between production, consumption, and impacts to the earth’s ecosystem and human health. Students learn how to analyze product/service systems and are expected to perform a Life Cycle Analysis based on the Okala Design framework. Students also are asked to investigate and communicate a product backstory to an existing product. The final exercise of the course involves the creation of a new product/service system that provides a framework for users to affect and modulate the environmental and social impacts throughout their relationship with that object.

Claude Levi-Strauss’ observation that “animals are good to think” is the starting point from which we make, discuss, and examine the ways in which works of art imagine the interrelationships between the human, the animal, and our environment. If we can only perceive these things through mediation (media representations), then how we represent them is the fundamental question, reflecting our ideologies, prejudices, hopes, and fears. Do we speak for animals, and if so what are we saying for them? Are they friends, pets, environmental equals, or beasts? How are hybrid monsters (chimera) created and what do they mean? How do we understand our places as subjects in a landscape or a data-scape? How can anthropomorphic cuteness be subversive? This course focuses on questions of intention, relation, and subjectivity, through critical engagement with representations of people, animals, monsters, and mutants, in their respective environments. The class is further focused on the use of character in context, via toy design, robotics, animation, video, image generation, or data visualization. There are introductory texts on character development, and generally an emphasis on literary, philosophical, and natural history texts, including Jorge Luis Borges, John Berger, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway, Rebecca Solnit, Steve Baker, Deleuze, and Guattari. Assignments include studio work and readings. There is more emphasis on the development and analysis of ideas, and less emphasis on particular media or forms. Students make several short projects, backed up by readings and research into precedent art works. There is a final project.

Even as our technologies become smaller and more versatile, we find ourselves bending down towards our keyboards and screens, and much of what we communicate with our bodies gets lost in translation. In Thinking Physically, we work to open ourselves back up and embrace the rich capabilities and inherent expressiveness of the human form. Starting with the body itself, we think about how it works and take a brief look at motion studies and biomechanics. Next, we examine how we use our bodies to relate to each other, considering physical social perceptions, proxemics, and cultural contexts. We then work to become better listeners, striving to sense the subtleties of body language, gesture, and nonverbal communication. Finally, it’s time to put those listening skills to work, designing interfaces that perceive the body’s communicative nature and encourage people to interact in a more physical way. Thinking Physically is a hands-on workshop in which we get up and move. Students create experiments and prototypes (both conceptual and technical) in response to weekly topics and design a body-centric final project based on what they’ve learned. Curated uses of the body (dance, physical comedy, sports, etc.), act as inspiration, but students focus on the everyman as the target user for the projects they create. With a toolbox of sensors, wearable techniques, and rugged interfaces in hand, we capture and provoke full-bodied expression. By acknowledging and extending the body’s impact, we create projects that appeal to the whole physical self.",

This course takes an analytical approach to unraveling and understanding these charged moments. In the process of the studying how and why strangers interact in public, we address some of the abiding themes at ITP— urban behavior, spontaneous interaction, the pleasure of the unexpected, how technology can mediate and/or enable human experience—and we make a close and thorough examination of how they play out in this narrow slice of human experience. This approach is designed to bring students to a more concrete understanding of these larger abstract ideas. Classwork consists of readings, class discussions, field assignments (a series of assigned interactions with strangers that the students document and discuss) and an analytical final paper. Students learn how the interactions of strangers have changed historically (and why), what the experience of interaction with strangers means to the participants, how strangers ‘read’ each other, how they initiate interactions, how they avoid interactions, how they trust each other and how they fool each other. Readings range from seminal works on urban sociology and public behavior (Georg Simmel, Stanley Milgram, Erving Goffman, Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Elijah Anderson) to more lyrical examinations of strangers in cities (Tim Etchells, Italo Calvino, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Edgar Allan Poe) to recent neuropsychiatric discoveries about trust, mimicry, and flash judgments. Because stranger interactions are at heart a means to interrupt the expected narrative of the everyday, we consider the works of artists and thinkers who show how such disruption, surprise, spontaneity, and play are fundamental to the pleasure and substance of urban life, for example: the Situationists and their descendents, Sophie Calle, Marina Abramovic, Francis Alys, Graffiti Research Lab, Robert Rauschenberg, Survival Research Labs.

As the available inputs and UI change with each device, so does the content, design limitations, and the narrative. We currently live in a world where we interact with content in three main environments: one foot—cell phone/iPod, two foot—computer, and 10-foot—television and with each of these devices we have to accommodate our content and interaction accordingly, and allow for the content to follow the user between these devices, but maintain a classic and intuitive user experience.

Furthermore, we examine the power of persuasive technologies in creating opportunities for communicating nonhuman intentions and viewpoints. Readings range from Douglas Adams on Genuine People Personalities, to Frank Herbert’s Without Me, You’re Nothing, Friedrich Juenger’s The Failure of Technology, to BJ Fogg, Nass, and Rives, and the work in Critical Design by Dunne and Raby, among others. Through class discussion, readings and examples we identify human emotional/social touchpoints: jealousy, seduction, fear, risk, reward, etc. Students conduct their own analyses of a manipulation technique, and of its corresponding persuasive technology application. For the second assignment students develop and present a persuasive technology concept for a nonhuman object or viewpoint.

Students gain a studied and nuanced understanding of the idea of intimacy and the physical and emotional experiences associated with it— as well as examining how existing and cutting edge technologies work to connect intimates across the physical and metaphorical distances they routinely experience in everyday life. The first section of the course is devoted to studying intimacy, bonding, attachment, longing and desire from a variety of perspectives. These include psychology and psychoanalysis— e.g.: Freud, Erich Fromm, Lacan, Kristeva, John Bowlby on attachment, Jessica Benjamin on bonding, Donald Winnicott on intersubjectivity; recent neuroscience, neurochemistry, and evolutionary biology related to intimacy and bonding; and recent psychological work specifically regarding intimacy and the internet. The second section of the course focuses on current art and technology projects—along with commercial ventures—that explore mediated intimacy across distances (the examples are legion). We scrutinize these projects to understand what they do right and what they do wrong. And we investigate the language and syntax of mediated intimacy, including attempts to incorporate each of (or combinations of) the human senses into devices of connectedness. In seeking to articulate what makes a meaningful mediated experience of intimacy, the course also looks at a group of edge cases—for example, personal performances in public (from web-cam girls to performance art)—that support asymmetrical intimacies. Through this process, we attempt to define a set of possible methods from which to create work. Classwork includes short papers throughout the semester and a final research paper or research-based project proposal.",

Designing technologies for communications requires an understanding of networks. This course is a foundation in how networks work. Through weekly readings and class discussions and a series of short hands-on projects, students gain an understanding of network topologies, how the elements of a network are connected and addressed, what protocols hold them together, and what dynamics arise in networked environments. This class is intended to supplement the many network- centric classes at ITP. It is broad survey, both of contemporary thinking about networks, and of current technologies and methods used in creating them. Prerequisites: Students should have an understanding of basic programming (Intro to Computational Media or equivalent). Familiarity with physical computing (Intro to Physical Computing or equivalent) is helpful, but not essential. Some, though not all, production work in the class requires programming and possibly physical and electronic construction. There is a significant reading component to this class as well. Possible topics include: * topologies: how to think about them (nodes and links), how few workable ones there are, and how there’s no topology so stupid it isn’t in use some place. * addressing and routing: what a namespace is, three ways to generate a name (nesting, serial uniqueness, random pseudo- uniqueness), the difference between smart and dumb networks, why the phone network and the internet differ even though they use the same wires * protocols: envelopes and contents, the stack and the reference lie, end-to-end principles, reliability vs. speed tradeoffs * scale: more is different, scale breaks otherwise workable systems, makes redundancy and degeneracy critical, tends to push systems * a discussion of security and its effects Possible exercises include: * Basic socket communication, both software and embedded hardware versions * Client-server programming * A group protocol/messaging exercise * An HTTP/RESTian model exercise",

This course offers a new approach to materiality, positing that all matter is dynamic but exists within a continuum of control ranging from passively temporal (wood, water) to electronically active (photovoltaics, thermochromics) to biologically alive (plants, tissue). This course presents alternative design strategies for creating computational interfacing with living matter and state change of natural materials. Students are introduced to the world of the bio lab from a designer’s perspective, both conceptually and practically. We examine the state-of-the-art in artistic experimentation with biological systems such as the genetic manipulation projects of Eduardo Kac, or the carbon nanotubes grown into architectural structures of Ryan Wartena. We also examine more DIY approaches to living systems integration and interactivity with biological systems. Students use a hands-on approach in their design process, with biological sensing as input and indicators or material state change as an alternative method of information display, for example. This course is designed to further our computational relationship with the natural world pushing forward ideas in sustainability, interactivity, energy production and the emerging relationship between the designer/artist and the bio lab, approaching biology as an open frontier for digital design.",

From the Iranian “Twitter revolution” in Azadi square to Sri Lankan bloggers, from post-election Kenyan crowdsourcing to the grassroots humanitarian Katrina response, to the Obama election, this class will investigate technologies created or re-purposed for socio-political change. What are the design and implementation issues? If we view government as a “platform,” what does that mean for new interfaces? Are all governments a stable compilation? If not, what are the implications for interaction design? Is there any way to avoid bias in application design? How do we accommodate for those with whom we do not agree? How should transparency and security issues be properly balanced when these issues are translated in applications? What are the real tools that have been used or are being used right now to rectify injustice and bring positive social change? What have been their advantages and disadvantages, and how has political context defined their use? How does the digital divide modify the outcome? Together in this class we will look at live global case studies to answer these questions, from the viewpoint of the individual user of both government and technology. We will review underlying design issues around freedom of information and privacy, structured change vs. creative chaos, crisis-driven vs. long-term change, and strength in numbers vs. the value of dissent, all with an eye towards producing good new ideas for positive social change. You will be asked to select one case study to follow through the semester, be given readings and outside speakers will be invited to present issues. You will present your case study findings and will be expected to integrate your findings into your final assignment: one prototype for potential or actual implementation.

How do you hide the equipment in nesting places, feeding places, and other regularly visited spots? Can you attach tracking radios to the animals themselves without causing them hardship? How do you “ruggedize” the equipment? How do you gather data from the equipment you’ve placed regularly and reliably? These challenges are related to common interaction design problems with humans, so understanding and mastering them is valuable experience for interaction designers. For anthropologists, zoological, and veterinary researchers, understanding the technologies behind their tracking equipment, and the approach that technology designers take in developing and deploying these tools can benefit their research. The goal of this class is to give students an introduction to the technological challenges of tracking and observation of wildlife. Specifically, students are presented with the challenges faced by Professor Anthony Di Fiore’s research group in tracking spider monkeys in Ecuador. Students discuss the challenges associated with spider monkey research, survey the state of the art in animal tracking with a focus on appropriate tools for this research project, and work in groups to develop interactive prototypes to address one or more of these challenges. Our hope is that this class serves both to introduce students to the subject, and also develop some workable prototypes that could be developed further in future semesters, either through other research projects related to this particular work, or on their own. In order to realize the goals of this class, students have access to current tracking tools: radio collars, “ruggedized” cameras, microphones, and other current tracking technologies. We also introduce common sensor and communication technologies used in physical interaction design practice.

This is an experimental class to first explore different ways we might read poetry, using published work of modern or traditional poets. Students are encouraged to use media that they are most comfortable with—animation, video, processing, etc. There are writing exercises based on the poems we use in class. Through this work we explore what makes a poem a poem. It’s not necessarily rhyme or meter, but there are underlying structures and guidelines: the use of tension, stresses; how and where a poem ‘turns’ to deliver an inevitable surprise; what is left unsaid, that a poem does not explain...and more. Students begin to explore different ways to write poetry...thinking of it perhaps not so much as a reading or even spoken experience, but maybe as something else. Who knows? This class, like writing poetry, is about discovering what it’s about...but at least we know that we will read some great poetry, play with new ways of experiencing it, and create some new work of our own.

How can sound effect the way people engage and perceive public space? Aside from an examination of the physical attributes of sound itself, this first section involves presentations and research into the histories sound art and sound design within the contexts of urban environments. With this in mind, this research is directed towards the second phase of the course: the production of a sound- based work that is to be proposed for public space in New York. Emphasis is given to situating sound both spatially and temporally, understanding the work in terms of site specificity as well as its location within the larger discourses and histories of sound, design and urbanism. Technical prerequisites are basic sound programs such as Audacity or any basic knowledge of some form of sound-making tools. Course examples may be given using Max/MSP, Processing, Logic, physical computing etc., but only to illustrate concept. The focus is on the content and context of the works, and participants are responsible for defining the best tools for the deployment of their ideas. Final works are presented as working prototypes/designs or full deployments of the sound interventions.

Overall, we learn strategies for creating richer and more subtle technology projects that ask users or participants for their contingent acceptance of the project’s reality. Coursework includes weekly readings, field experiments, and short papers. The semester is split into two overarching themes — the first is Humanness. When we attribute human-esque responsiveness or behavioral and emotional characteristics to a non-human, what cognitive processes are we engaging? What are some of the most persuasive signals of humanness, signals that are powerful enough to convey humanness even in the absence of other cues? Topics and readings include: • Establishing a working definition of authenticity; • The uncanny (Freud); • Theory of mind, intuition, empathy (Selections from The Missing Link in Cognition, on primates); • Dead or Alive (Mary Shelley, Frankenstein; other monsters); • Projection: animism & anthropomorphizing (Sherry Turkle, Pascal Boyer); • Responsive machines (various studies of social and humanoid robots). The second is Identities and environments. What is authenticity of person or of place? By what cues do we attribute authenticity to individual identities and constructed environments? How many or few cues does it take for us to read a system, a person, a constructed world as authentic? What lessons for technology makers are to be learned by investigating abnormal psychology, world-building, and manipulated truth/trust? Topics and readings include: • Broken perception— delusions of false worlds (selections on misidentification syndromes, e.g. Cotard’s, Fregoli delusion, reduplicative paramnesia, Capgras); • Unreality in unreal systems/environments (Coraline, Metal Snake/Ps ycho Mantis [game], Philip K. Dick’s Ubiq); • Historical hoaxes (case studies including Piltdown Man, Barnum’s Feejee Mermaid, the original Mechanical Turk); • Imposters (case studies including Kaycee Nicole, lg15, Our First Time, Frédéric Bourdin, Martin Guerre); • The long con (selections from The Big Con and case studies of internetbased cons, e.g. 419s and other pigeon-drop cons).",

This seminar studies how our understanding of sound and light has developed over time and across scientific and creative disciplines. We pay particular attention to the phenomenology and perceptual effects of sound and light, and to what Michel Chion calls “the audiovisual effect” (the cognitive fusion of audible and visible stimuli). The course surveys areas that include acoustics, cognitive science, data sonification, acoustic ecology, industrial design, audible user-interface design, music, architecture, sound and light art, lighting design, and sound design for film and theater. This is not a production course; assignments consist of weekly readings, research, and writing.",

At the same time the field of interaction design, and indeed design in general, has placed new emphasis on value sensitive design and the user’s “well-being”. Central to both social and interaction design is the notion of the “other” and the importance of empathy, observation, imagination, understanding and iteration as part of the design process. In the first part of the semester we review proposed interaction design methodologies as well as current approaches to social design from the fields of economics, philosophy and policy. In the second part of the semester students are given a list of specific design challenges and design constrains to work with and provide solutions. A feasibility study and demonstration of how their process and proposed solution fit within a larger framework of design occupies the last part of the semester.",

Mature web technologies such as HTML5, Javascript, and CSS3 are powerful alternatives for maintaining an open and interoperable future, and mobile web browsers are now capable of exposing their rich set of features with which to work. This course covers the fundamental aspects of developing and deploying online and offline applications for mobile devices based on these advanced browser capabilities. The course starts with a quick overview of the major mobile computing platforms and their native application development models. We then move on to developing web applications for mobile screens — focusing on mobile browser capabilities and optimizing web applications for small touchscreens. Students learn how to use HTML5, CSS, and Javascript frameworks like JQuery, as well as server-side PHP/MySQL, to build applications that are virtually indistinguishable from platform-native applications. The final portion of the class covers the PhoneGap application framework, which allows developers to create cross-platform native applications, using web technologies, that access handset hardware capabilities (GPS, accelerometer, camera, etc.) that are typically reserved for applications developed with platform SDK’s. Introduction to Computational Media or equivalent programming experience is required, and familiarity with web technologies is strongly encouraged.",

This change in the economics of communication has opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several profound effects in the media landscape today. This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries — newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking — faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere. This course covers the history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation from weblogs and wikis and Twitter to fan fiction and lolcats.

Today a considerable amount of content is consumed on mobile devices and laptops which excludes the cinematic experience of spatial sound. With the current rise of cinematic VR and the blurring line between gaming and experiential VR, spatial audio is no longer just an added bonus, but rather a necessity in designing immersive VR experiences. In this course we will explore the emerging field of 3D sound design and for both 360 video and game engine-built VR using a digital audio workstation, game engines, and 3D audio plugins. Intro to 3D Printing - 2.0 Units ITPG.GT.2757.001 Xuedi Chen 3D environments and objects are powerful prototyping tools. This class will introduce the basics of 3D modeling techniques in Rhino and students will learn to create assets for prototyping and 3D printing. The class will take an industrial design approach to design and build with specifications and materials in mind. Students will learn to think, plan, design, and produce well thought out objects to fit their specific needs. (examples: motor mounts, enclosures, wearables etc.) Intro to Fabrication - 2.0 Units ITPG.GT.2637.001 Benjamin Light Time to get your hands dirty. Prototypes need to be created, motors have to be mounted, enclosures must be built. Understanding how things are fabricated makes you a better maker. But hardware is hard. You can't simply copy and paste an object or working device (not yet anyway), fabrication skills and techniques need to be developed and practiced in order to create quality work. You learn to make by doing. In this class you will become familiar and comfortable with all the ITP shop has to offer. We will cover everything from basic hand tools to the beginnings of digital fabrication. You will learn to use the right tool for the job. There will be weekly assignments created to develop your fabrication techniques. There will be in class lectures, demos, and building assignments. Emphasis will be put on good design practices, material choice, and craftsmanship.",

These ideas have led to concrete advancements in long-standing applied domains such as classification and time-series prediction. But the real excitement over Deep Learning lies in its yet untapped potential. This course will introduce some of the core technical concepts within Deep Learning and explore how these emerging capabilities will transform the next generation of computing interfaces such as search engines, intelligent assistants, connected homes and open-world video games. We will use class time and weekly incremental programming exercises to explore the underlying theory and key algorithms of machine learning as well as some of the more abstract insights offered by Deep Learning into vexing phenomenological questions like: Why do we replay and reconfigure memories in our dreams? Why do we use only a small portion of our brains at any given time? Why can we catch a baseball without being able to recite Newton's equations? And most importantly, what defines learning as a phenomenon? We will also look at the emerging applications of these technologies to art, design and toolmaking and explore more advanced machine learning tools such as Google's TensorFlow library.

It is a rapidly growing field, enabled by the recent decrease in cost and increase in throughput of DNA sequencing technology. We can now measure the microbial component of our environment and have the opportunity to incorporate this new microbial metric into the design of our built environments and products. In this class we will cover a basic understanding of the state of current research in environmental microbiomes. Students will get hands-on experience in which they will collect their own samples, obtain DNA sequences, and learn the computational methods to analyze genomic data. We will design physical devices to interact with this invisible component of our environment, either in form of sampling instruments, bioreactors or bio receptive substrates that propose new symbiotic relationships with the microbial environment. By the completion of this course, students will be able to: * Understand of the state of current research in environmental microbiomes * Hands on experience gathering samples and computational methods for DNA sequence analysis for individual samples and comparative methods for large datasets * Introduce speculative thinking to their practice * Materialize concepts with new strategies for rapid product prototyping * Develop technological visions that provoke thought rather than communicate a vision of how things will or should be  We will work with free and publicly available datasets.

In this class we will systematically work our way through a four-step method to improve your ability to connect with your audience. We will explore the science that explains why stories work. We will tackle a basic framework for what a story is, using a process and foundation to develop any talk or presentation. Now that we have what you are going to say, we will also focus on how you say it, along with strategies to give you confidence to be your best self when speaking in front of a crowd. This is a particularly good class to take in preparation for your thesis in the Spring. This seminar examines and deconstructs verbal storytelling as a discipline in its own right. It is an exploration of speaking and storytelling as a fundamental building block of human evolution and innovation. We will look at the learnings from ancient times through modern scientific research-looking at theories attempting to explain what happens physiologically and psychologically when we are moved by a spoken narrative. This is a contextual approach that will focus on both the theory and the application in the marketplace of developing and delivering narrative as it relates to presenting oneself, a product or a service. As such, we seek to understand what drives current trends toward narrative education and storytelling as a competitive advantage in learning, communicating, persuading and influencing.

Geekiness, once a mark of stigma, has transformed into an important focus for creators, marketers, and a million internet celebs. Fandom is the study of the communities that form around popular culture, whether based on a shared love of Star Wars, the New York Yankees, Taylor Swift, or 3D printing. Good fan management can lead to hordes of adoring, evangelical users; bad fan interactions can spell shame and embarrassment. From Pokemon to Air Jordans, this class explores the influences and motivations that have led to the current renaissance in fandom. We chart the evolution of fan culture as a social and economic force, from early 15th century religious manias to its present rebirth in the age of digital connectivity and anonymity. Commercialization, appropriation, monetization, love-bombing, all of these are important tools for any project creator who wants to inspire large groups of people to do their bidding.",

    "description": "As game and interaction designers we create systems and choices that can either prey upon our psychological foibles or help us avoid decision pitfalls. It is our responsibility to understand how we decide, to consider the ethics of the systems we create and to practice designing systems in a purposeful manner. Game Design & The Psychology of Choice will provide interaction and game designers with an understanding of the factors that influence behavior and decision-making by looking at the intertwining of cognitive psychology and economics through the development of behavioral economics. These disciplines study behavior on the individual and group level, often revealing some of the why behind the rules of thumb and folk wisdom that game designers come to intuitively. But understanding the why-why we fall into decision traps; why certain tradeoffs tax our brain more than others; why we are overconfident about our abilities; why certain decisions make us uncomfortable-allows us to more purposefully apply our design craft, both in and out of games. Finally, as a class, we will take what we learn about how we think and create series of game experiences based around key cognitive science concepts. Assignments may include: *Mod a cognitive science experiment into a game or experience *Analyze and present a game through the lens of cognitive science and behavioral economics *Create game or experience based around a particular insight from cognitive science or behavioral economics",

We now have the potential to give life to inanimate objects, tell stories through space, customizing private views of public spaces and recognize places we've never been. We'll question what it means and how can we blend reality exploring themes such as: augmented space and new paradigms in social interaction, public space and privacy; storytelling and navigating the physical space like turning pages in a book; tangible interfaces, mixed objects and animism; Magic windows, x-ray vision, time-machines and impossible universes; Far away so close: telepresence and remote collaboration. The course will survey the past, current and up and coming technologies and experiences in Mixed Reality including environmental augmented reality and interactive projection mapping, handheld devices and head mounted displays fostering a strong user experience perspective on the affordances and constraints of each. We'll research and discuss the design principles and guidelines for creating mixed reality experiences focusing on the links between real and virtual objects, interaction space and asymmetries between physical and digital worlds, environmental semantics and multimodal and tangible interaction.

Extensive readings and case studies provide background for class discussions on the theory and practice of designing gestural controllers for musical performance. Students design and prototype a musical instrument - a complete system encompassing musical controller, algorithm for mapping input to sound, and the sound output itself. A technical framework for prototyping performance controllers is made available. Students focus on musical composition and improvisation techniques as they prepare their prototypes for live performance.

How do you leave your own trail of documentation that can contribute to a body of knowledge beyond the products of your own art? These forms of research may mix a variety of scientific and intuitive methods. The artist/designer is free to employ speculation, open-endedness, and irony; to use design as a way to probe or even provoke the chosen fields of inquiry. The class is devoted to the question of how to initiate and investigate research and incorporate it intelligently and sensitively into your work. This class is about developing your own idiosyncratic and well-documented means of pulling threads, following leads, and becoming fearless about asking for help and others' expertise. You become a temporary expert.

Simply seeing a cause-and-effect relationship between movement (input) and media (output) is not enough. This course re-conceives interactive media as a form of choreographic intervention. Instead of asking how dancers can control media, we will turn the tables to ask how interactive systems can influence movement. How do you make someone feel soft inside? How do you shake an entire room? How do you orchestrate duets between strangers? To accomplish this, choreographers will learn to apply computational thinking to choreography and programmers will learn to apply choreographic thinking to computation. And to whatever extent possible, we will attempt to embody code. Using computer vision and a broad range of media from graphics and video, to sound and text, we will look at directing both how people move (quality of movement) as well as where they move (pathways and spatial relationships).

With the accelerated pace of technological innovation it is becoming harder to keep pace with the impact technology has on our lives and the way we relate with each other - objects in the mirror are beginning to coincide with the mirror. Creating future scenarios gives us agency, makes us realize the power and responsibility we have in longterm planning, and opens up the space for a rigorous conversation on ethics, design, toolmaking, privacy, authenticity, and other issues. Good scenario planning considers not just one, but multiple, carefully researched views of the future, comparing and contrasting them to decide on a course of action. As Peter Schwartz points out in The Art of the Long View, \"the point is to make strategic decisions that will be sound for all plausible futures.... The end result, [of scenario planning], is not an accurate picture of tomorrow, but better decisions about the future.\" Scenario planning using a systems view changes the way we see not only the future, but how we make decisions about the present as well. In this class, students will develop skills in future scenario planning grounded in systems thinking and research about the present and the past. We will work together to determine a question that concerns us about our future five to ten years forward. From there, we will articulate factors that are relevant to the question: driving forces, current conditions and trends which can be extrapolated, and critical uncertainties. Using this research as both source material and constraint, students will split into groups to develop multiple scenarios describing the future date which the class is examining. Final projects will be a series of live group presentations of your scenario, with multimedia support as needed. By the end of the class, students will: Strengthen their ability to research technologies and their effects Become familiar with systems thinking as a tool for planning and design Gain a familiarity with current approaches to scenario planning (e.g. Royal Dutch Shell, SRI, IFTF, etc.) Strengthen both written and in-person presentation skills",

    "description": "Democratizing media by breaking it down into discrete more easily remixable parts has historically led to an explosion of expression and knowledge creation. The invention of alphabets allowed for broad literacy and then the moveable type of the printing press ignited the enlightenment. The arrival of DNA allowed for our diversity and evolution of all life forms. Motion pictures, perhaps our most convincing medium, is now undergoing such a transformation thanks to virtual reality technologies. The iconic immersive headset is a distraction compare to the VR technologies for scanning, modeling and rendering reality using shared, reusable elements instead of just pixels. Specifically we will look at tools like depth cameras that can gather foreground elements like people and props from a scene so they can be rearranged or substituted separately from the background. Superimposing panoramic video or rendered backgrounds can save the need to pull up a army of truck and crew to shoot on location and by allowing directors to later change their shot angles rather than pulling up the truck again to reshoot. New scanning, avatar generation and libraries of 3D objects has saved you the need of the army of modelers you see in 20 minutes of credits roll at the end of a sci fi movie. These scanning capabilities as well as the ability to realtime render those models is finding its way into small inexpensive devices like the phones that most people in the world are carrying around in their pocket. All of these cover the visible parts of cinema but we will also discuss how the less visible structure of story, the plots and sequences might be templated into reusable formulas for non experts to find emotionally satisfying dramatic arcs. Most importantly cinema is made more out of reusable, shared elements and templates, it becomes comparable and conversational. You could find exactly how your story overlaps and intersects with other in a shared \"space\" of stories. In particular AI technology shows promise in finding clusters of similar compositions across the many permutations of possible stories. This would make it more fun to share your construction of reality with friends but also potentially more responsible that your construction of reality has to be put in context of others. The purpose of this class is not for professional film directors (and politicians) who have already discovered these new tools for publishing their constructions of reality. Instead this class is about the true potential of virtual reality, its mutability, to put ordinary users in the role of director as they already are in their dreams and fantasies. The course will emphasize tools like cameras that for capturing the user's expression with the results display in conventional 16:9 format over tools of immersion like headsets that emphasize pushing thing to the person. The aesthetic will be rough juxtapositions in the traditions of comics, cubism, collage, storyboards and previs that quickly capture the your interior space without being slavish to verisimilitude of cartesian 3D scenes. Most importantly the output must delivered in the unflattened open source formats of the web where every element remains discrete and addressable with a URL. For these reasons the class examples will be in javascript using tools like three.js, kinectron, and mlabs. Students can possibly use Unity or Unreal supported by online resources.",

Will the computer's ability to run more objective statistical analysis on data gathered tirelessly over time, across individuals and locations allow us to more accurately see ourselves and the world as it is.

The insights into how into how to reach people more fully comes with a responsibility to then ask what should say to them. As the computers are able to understand us better than we understand ourselves will we relinquish control to them? At a practical level the class looks at interfaces for capturing the less consciously controlled parts of your body using things like biosensors and cameras. Then we look at such things as subliminal displays for reaching past the normal conscious model of human understanding.

We're trading an increasingly hostile natural environment for a socially networked and commercially driven artificial one. Whether it's the bedrooms of YouTube streaming stars, the augmented Pokestops of Pokemon Go, the virtual tourism of the latest humanitarian crisis or even the \"airspace\" of Airbnb; we are witnessing a dramatic transformation of what occupying space means. So where are these dramatic spatial paradigm shifts occurring? Who owns and occupies these spaces? Who are the architects and what historical and ethical foundations are they working from? What world do they want to build for humanity and where does the creative individual fit into it? Will it be a walled garden, a role-playing adventure or a tool for creating more worlds? The course will ask students to embrace the role of virtual architect, not in the traditional brick-and-mortar sense of constructing shelter, but in terms of the engagement with the raw concept of space. However this virtual space must be considered and evaluated as a \"site\" that is activated and occupied by real people and all the limitations of physical space that they bring with them from the real world. This is the foundation of synthetic architecture; simulated space met with biological perception. This conceptual architecture is free from the confines of physics but host to a whole new set of questions : How do we embrace the human factors of a dimensionless environment? How do we make or encourage meaningful interactions within the limits of current technology? New models of interaction must inform and shape the architecture of virtual space - what does that look like? How can architecture and aesthetics inform the creation of virtual environments and immersive narratives? How do we acutely consider the psychological and social impacts of the worlds we design and what is the metaphorical ground plane to make sense of this virtual world, unbound by physics? In addition to close examination of these questions via lecture, reading and discussion, the course is highly experimental and production-heavy; students greatly benefit from prior knowledge of 3d modeling/rendering software (Maya, C4D, Max) and current game engines (Unity, Unreal). Focus will be on designing and developing VR experiences for the HTC VIVE, however the lessons learned are applicable to other VR, AR and interactive formats. Students should be prepared to be intrigued and frustrated by this emerging medium, and will be encouraged to become a part of the current VR dialog, recognizing that the standards for constructing and interacting with virtual worlds are still very much undefined. Ultimately students should walk away with a personal virtual world building language that communicates his or her intended values and aesthetics.",

    "description": "With the release of consumer head mounted displays the current wave of virtual reality is in full swing. It seems that everyone is making software and hardware for VR or is in the distribution game. One issue still remains and could be the biggest challenge for virtual reality to be embraced by the masses - there isn't that much good content yet. Worlds on a Wire will explore the history, current status, and future of head mounted displays for use in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and teach the necessary tools for creating meaningful experiences and narratives that transcend the hardware and the hype. Students will work to produce a head mounted display experience using the Unreal Engine with strong physical computing and fabrication components. Course Prerequisites: Introductory level coding skills and familiarity with 3D computer graphics workflow. Previous experience using 3D content creation tools and game engines is a plus.",

    "description": "In this class we will be creating robots that travel along the XYZ axes. Our bots will draw, paint, push, and plant. You will gain an understanding of both the best practices of design and the anatomy of gantry machines by assembling and working with existing CNC kits. We will exploit robust off-the-shelf solutions for the X and Y, and reinvent the Z. There will be a heavy focus on concept, mechatronics, and fabrication.",
