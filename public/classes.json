It is an act of choreographing a series of events in another person’s mind. How is it different from, for example, making a movie? In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and “spoon-fed” to the audience (at least, on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product’s functionality/experience. Here, the user’s experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This class explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, the class redesigns an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, the class designs a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality.

It is an act of choreographing a series of events in another person's mind. How is it different from, for example, making a movie? In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and \"spoon-fed\" to the audience (at least, on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product's functionality/experience. Here, the user's experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This class explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, the class redesigns an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, the class designs a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality.

For many of these projects, interactive solutions have developed only after an initial (linear) work was already completed In this sense new media artists have been asked to consider interactivity only as an afterthought. This class seeks to bring interactive development to the forefront of the creative documentary process. Students first work to understand the nature of documentary production such that interactive solutions may be developed at the beginning and continue throughout the process. This course also examines what types of documentaries may be developed when new media and interactivity are kept in mind from the beginning Students consider the nature of basic documentary production from concept to research, fact gathering, interviews, and storytelling. This overview is the starting point from which students develop their own concepts for creating interactive documentaries. Various existing documentary projects are studied in terms of their process and to examine their attempts to utilize interactive technology.

Just sharing information? So why are they so important? Information Contours explores the nature of the information flows that are generated by evolving and ever-innovating information technology (IT). Are digital media and network connections the most democratic of media, or are they circumscribed by gatekeepers\" and \"walled gardens\"? How can we intelligently analyze the relationship between information and communication technologies and people? What is “intellectual property,” and what role does copyright and patent protection play in expanding or constricting accessible information? IT now suggests the contours that information assumes are the lifeblood of democracy. Yet information, this assumed basic ingredient of democracy, is increasingly produced, manufactured, privatized, and marketed as a commodity. What of this? And where are the markers describing and contrasting the public's interest in information with, for example, copyright laws that now summon you to a courthouse for unauthorized sharing? The free flow of information has been undermined by the increasing application and expansion of copyright and patent law to further the privatization commodification, and control of information. Yet original and open cultural expression requires democratic access to information sources and the means of information production and dissemination. As IT-computers, telephony, bioengineering software, Internet, etc.- increases the quantity of, and applications for, information in society, cultural, social, economic, political, legal, and ethical ramifications multiply. In countless ways, large and small, public and private, IT is both harnessed to achieve specific goals and, by virtue of its existence, shapes the way culture is informed. Through the power of IT, information succeeds as an autonomous aggrandizing value. Does this indicate a fundamental change for society? As IT becomes more ubiquitous and embedded in culture, transformative issues arise as to its applicability, extension, and direction. Civil society is experiencing a shift in the value of information including its nomenclature, applications, and normative function. Progress in IT increasingly focuses our attention on the way in which information influences culture and thereby informs contemporary democracy. What is the relation between information flows, culture, economics, government, and democracy? How are we going to govern/direct all of this technology? Is there really a form of culture here-cyberspace-that we have not known before and that will require new forms of control? Or is cyberspace an electronic version of ordinary space where traditional forms of governing will suffice? Information Contours explores all of this and more.","instructor":["Libarle"],"credits":null,"year":2005,"words":["aggrandizing,2005","constricting,2005","commodification,2005"],"group":14},{"id":"course_175,2005","course":"course_175","title":"Storytelling for Active and Interactive Media","description":"This seminar, designed primarily for writers and performers, explores the story as a form for communication and considers how storytelling and engagement change depending on the medium.

This course traces and questions whether the historical notion of privacy is adequate to champion individual autonomy in an interactive digital age. The course examines how privacy is increasingly encompassed by information technology. Various computing applications have been proposed, and in some cases implemented, that have the potential of being invasive of privacy such as RFID and the successors to governmental programs such as Total Information Awareness. Is it possible to address privacy concerns with intelligent design of core technologies? What are the privacy issues connected with biometrics, smart cards, data-mining, and pattern analysis? Is privacy an effective or adequate notion for protecting personal information? This course analyzes how in various technical, legal, and political ways, privacy is incapacitated and lost. The course offers new approaches to thinking about what privacy is and what information autonomy means. Privacy is analyzed in terms of existing policies of restraint in contrast to the next generation of embedded privacy.

In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and \"spoon-fed' to the audience (at least on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product's functionality/experience. Here, the user's experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This course explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, students redesign an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, they design a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality.

Students bring their knowledge of interactive telecommunications to drawing and find ways to let drawing enter into their practice. In this introductory drawing class, students are urged to draw anything they want, exploring the freedom of expression that comes from playing with one's imagination and memory and creating convincing imagery with or without references. The class visits galleries to look at contemporary art and have informal critiques.

Realworld conversations require everyone to be in the same place at the same moment; by undoing those restrictions, the Internet has ushered in a host of new social patterns, from the mailing list to the chat room to the weblog. Designing such software is a problem that cannot be attacked in the same way as designing a word processor; designers of social software have more in common with economists or political scientists than they do with designers of single-user software, and operators of communal resources have more in common with politicians or landlords than with operators of ordinary Web sites. This course is based on the premise that we have only begun to figure out ways to support these new social patterns. The course begins with an overview of the 40-year history of social software and moves quickly to an examination of the tools and techniques available today, from weblogs and wikis to RSS feeds and connectivity through Wi-Fi.

Once, writers were professionally isolated from the tasks of visual design, information management, and programming. Now, in venues such as weblogs, online conferences, games, and interactive media, writing is part of a larger practice of communication. In this mix, the craft of writing often gets shortchanged or overlooked. Yet elegance and clarity of language are probably the most effective ways to make a piece of work resonate in the mind, and in the blood, of another person. This is a course on the use of elegant writing to make electronic work more powerful. The course covers not just the art and practice of putting one word or sentence in front of another, but also the more difficult challenges of listening to the world, figuring out what we have to say, and laying out the complexities of our thinking in a linear form that others can appreciate. Small assignments build to larger assignments; later assignments dovetail with projects for other courses or purposes. Students learn to interview effectively, to edit each other's work, to see their work as a naive reader would see it, to cut to size, to write promotional content that does not make readers want to gag, and to distinguish good writing from mediocre writing-particularly in the context of the new requirements of the Internet and Web audiences. By the end of the course, students accumulate a body of work, including participation in a course/ITP weblog. Note: While nonnative English speakers are welcome in the course, it requires relatively advanced facility with English.

Giving your idea over to users from the very beginning can improve both the quality of your application and the speed at which it develops. To that end, the course familiarizes students with rapid prototyping techniques rather than following a more traditional semester-long design process, and it is best suited to students seeking experience examining live usage of their concepts. Students form teams to design and launch a prototype built for a small core group of people they personally care about, who collectively approve and participate in each project at every stage. The core group may include both classmates and outside participants who already know each other and the creator(s) well enough to be invested in, and help to determine the direction of, the application. At the rapid design stage students are encouraged to restate flaws as features, promote self-interest and obscure topics, put forward solutions in search of problems, force concepts onto seemingly unsuitable technologies, all with the goal of putting something out to be used as quickly as possible by the core group. By the midterm, team projects are expected to be already in use and ready to be deployed. Teams continue to collect feedback from the core group and iterate while the project is live. As the project scope expands, teams spend the second half of the course studying the social effects of changing audiences, applying techniques to study usage rates and \"stickiness,\" acquiring user feedback automatically, and directing users to newly added features.

If you were to turn to a fellow student and say, “I do” or “I sentence you to five years in prison,” your listener would not become your spouse or be hustled off to Rikers. Nothing happens during a wedding or a sentencing hearing; those events are just special forms of talking. Yet talking, in those circumstances, creates real change in the world. There are two nested effects here-the inner one is the conditions under which speech becomes action, and the outer one is the ways we give groups the power to enforce those actions. Social software creates novel contexts for groups, but currently operates outside traditional social support for group action. For example, both corporations and online groups can have high degrees of internal cohesion and strive for external effects on the world but corporations have the blessing of society, as an official \"legal fiction,\" to take actions that ordinary groups, no matter how cohesive, are forbidden to take. That gap is mainly one of tradition-one can readily imagine alternate \"legal fictions\" to support alternate kinds of groups. This course is centered around weekly readings and class discussions of primary materials, some historical, some current, revolving around four questions: What effect does social software have on groups who want to take action in the world? How do groups come to binding decisions about the action they want to take? What are the traditional supports and constraints for real-world groups (corporations, governments, NGOs, etc.) that act on the world? And what new forms of social support can we imagine for groups that are mainly or solely organized online? The course features readings from political and economic theory of group action, the social structure of engaged (as opposed to merely conversational) groups, and field observations of real-world groups using social software.

Sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste together contribute to how we understand and experience our surroundings. Conventional input and output for interactive media has made very limited use of our sensory system. As ubiquitous computing expands and applications for interactivity extend to more atmospheric realms, so does the potential for more multisensory design. Our goal is to expand the palette of interaction design to more fully engage our sensory apparatus. A particular focus is on the aesthetic possibilities of such multisensory design. We look at our senses in various combinations, examining how they closely interact and relate with one another. While smell and taste may not necessarily be directly evoked, it is possible to inspire these through a curious combination of audiovisual and tactile stimuli.

Just sharing information? So why are they so important? Information Contours explores the nature of the information flows that are generated by evolving and ever-innovating information technology (IT). Are digital media and network connections the most democratic of media, or are they circumscribed by \"gatekeepers\" and \"walled gardens\"? How can we intelligently analyze the relationship between information and communication technologies and people? What is \"intellectual property,\" and what role does copyright and patent protection play in expanding or constricting accessible information? IT now suggests the contours that information assumes are the lifeblood of democracy. Yet information, this assumed basic ingredient of democracy, is increasingly produced, manufactured, privatized, and marketed as a commodity. What of this? And where are the markers describing and contrasting the public's interest in information with, for example, copyright laws that now summon you to a courthouse for unauthorized sharing? The free flow of information has been undermined by the increasing application and expansion of copyright and patent law to further the privatization, commoditization, and control of information. Yet original and open cultural expression requires democratic access to information sources and the means of information production and dissemination. As IT-computers, telephony, bioengineering, software, Internet, increases the quantity of, and applications for, information in society, cultural, social, economic, political, legal, and ethical ramifications multiply. In countless ways, large and small, public and private, IT is both harnessed to achieve specific goals and, by virtue of its existence, shapes the way culture is informed. Through the power of IT, information succeeds as an autonomous aggrandizing value. Does this indicate a fundamental change for society? As IT becomes more ubiquitous and embedded in culture, transformative issues arise as to its applicability, extension, and direction. Civil society is experiencing a shift in the value of information including its nomenclature, applications, and normative function. Progress in IT increasingly focuses our attention on the way in which information influences culture and thereby informs contemporary democracy. What is the relation between information flows, culture, economics, government, and democracy? How are we going to govern/direct all of this technology? Is there really a form of culture here-cyberspace-that we have not known before and that will require new forms of control? Or is cyberspace an electronic version of ordinary space where traditional forms of governing will suffice?

Students work in small teams to evolve their ideas from concept through design documentation to proof-of-concept. Each team presents a working prototype of an interactive media system for a public space at the end of the semester. Throughout the course, students learn basic project management skills that aid in the realization of innovative ideas. Weekly discussions briefly cover topical subjects such as tangible user interfaces, alternative feedback devices, wireless computing environments, and hybrid interactive systems that tie physical spaces to the Internet. The final project includes the presentation of the project with all supporting design documentation (written concept summary, flowcharts, storyboards, and scripts) and project presentation board.

Particular attention is given to social and community-based Web interaction. The production environment consists of the MySQL database and the PHP programming language. Students are expected to develop a firm knowledge of database design and optimization, the SQL query language, and the use of PHP to create dynamic activity of both orthodox and unorthodox nature. Late-semester topics focus on interfacing this environment with other technologies such as JavaScript and Flash, along with data population and site architecture methodology.

These most likely center on the telecommunications infrastructure, although they may also (at the students' discretion) include the global economy, international politics, environmental concerns, or other large-scale issues. Scenario planning is a rigorous but exciting technique, in which people share information and judgment to create a picture of the future larger than any individual could produce alone. The technique has been used for two decades to distinguish certainties from uncertainties and thus develop descriptions of the future that help put present-day decisions into context.

We understand intuitively that networked computers differ from stand-alone computers, or that a group of friends differs from an aggregation of anonymous individuals, but describing that difference clearly is difficult. In particular, networks exhibit emergent characteristics that cannot be explained simply by examining their constituent parts. People are not like computers, but networks of people and networks of computers are alike in many ways. It is the organization of the respective networks that creates those similarities. Network Effects is a course about the structure of networks and how that structure affects human experience. We focus in particular on two invisible networks-communications networks and social networks. Communications networks are invisible in the traditional sense; their inner workings are hidden from us. We examine a variety of communications networks and explore the ways different networks affect the experiences of their users. Social networks are invisible in a different way; because we are so immersed in myriad social networks-friends, family, work, school don't see them. We examine some of the structural elements of social networks, such as strong and weak ties, clustering, and small-worlds networks, to understand some of the ways that the shape of social networks affects us. The goal of the course is to synthesize observations about these two types of networks. Technological choices embodied in electronic networks profoundly affect their social dimensions: Why can we CC people on email but not on phone calls? How does the one-way network of television differ from the two-way network of the Internet? What effect does BitTorrent's architectural decentralization have on its users? Social choices also affect the design of technology; resistance to spamming or attempts to hide from the RIAA have led to several deep technological changes in the design of Weblogs and file-sharing networks, respectively, changes that alter the social relations among the users. The class meetings center on discussion of readings and lectures. Outside class, students complete two short papers, a midterm project, and a final paper or project. The midterm project involves designing and implementing a small network (though not necessarily a computer-mediated one) and describing its effects. The final is a project or research interest of the student's choice and involves designing, building, and describing a network; a visual and descriptive analysis of an existing network; or a research paper.","instructor":["Shirky"],"credits":null,"year":2007,"words":[],"group":9},{"id":"course_44,2007","course":"course_44","title":"Introduction to Interactive 3D and Virtual Spaces","description":"This course addresses the design and creation of 3D environments using Maya for modeling and animation and Virtools for adding interactivity.

To protect privacy, the ranks of experts, foundations, and watchdog groups expand. There is a growing tension between the economic needs of digital commerce and expectations of privacy as articulated by privacy advocates. What is “privacy”? This course traces and questions whether the historical notion of privacy is adequate to champion individual autonomy in an interactive digital age. The course examines how privacy is increasingly encompassed by information technology. Various computing applications have been proposed, and in some cases implemented, that have the potential of being invasive of privacy such as RFID and the successors to governmental programs such as Total Information Awareness. Is it possible to address privacy concerns with intelligent design of core technologies? What are the privacy issues connected with biometrics, smart cards, data-mining, and pattern analysis? Is privacy an effective or adequate notion for protecting personal information? This course analyzes how in various technical, legal, and political ways, privacy is incapacitated and lost. The course offers new approaches to thinking about what privacy is and what information autonomy means. Privacy is analyzed in terms of existing policies of restraint in contrast to the next generation of embedded privacy. This includes notions such as embedding information autonomy via computing architecture and building privacy parameters into the cyborg imaginary. This course lends itself to one of ITP's great assets: creativity. Students develop a conceptual understanding of privacy as an identity platform upon which can be embedded the architecture of digital autonomy.","instructor":["Libarle"],"credits":null,"year":2007,"words":[],"group":14},{"id":"course_134,2007","course":"course_134","title":"The Poetics of Virtual Space/Reinventing 3D","description":"This course is an invitation to discover the sensitivity of virtual space and to reinvent the unique feeling of being immersed in a virtual reality.

In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and \"spoon-fed\" to the audience (at least on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product's functionality/experience. Here, the user's experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This course explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, students redesign an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, they design a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality.

Considering these issues, students identify and improve the way they work with technology and particularly software design. The first session covers foundation concepts and techniques in visual computational media (principles of producing color, shape, composition, and motion), interaction/usability principles (GUI/UI, gesture mapping, locus of attention, affordance), sound design for interactive systems (live input analysis, multiple-samples management, synthesis), and overall project design (Colonel John Boyd's OODA loop). With this knowledge at hand, we observe how third-party software affects our work and in response we construct our own software tools. Students then use their tools to build toward a final project and provide an account of personal observations (for example, how much time was spent building the tools versus observing/practicing/using them, and how does this reflect on the final quality of the product). The course is delivered using Processing, but other platforms are welcomed and encouraged.

Who would be there? What would its main purpose be? Before you answer that question, let's take a look back. The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside-amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go. The public was very limited; children were usually not allowed in. They were elitist institutions whose mission was archiving the past. Today, although most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors, there are fundamental ways-attitudes, techniques, structural issues-that are still lodged in the 19th century. Now, because of a very different kind of Cabinet of Wonder, i.e., the computer and other IT technologies, museums are able to display collections, demonstrate concepts, and reach their audiences in new ways. Most have not taken full advantage of these new tools or had the time to explore how they might change the nature of a museum visit, but we do in this course. We document together the ways in which technology may enhance the museum experience. We evaluate the use of interactive technologies in museums and how that experience might be extended online. But first we observe and study what they do now. We cannot invent a new wheel before we understand the old one. In this course, we explore the different kinds of exhibits in museums (object-based collection, demonstrations of phenomena), historic or single topic museums (e.g., the Tenement Museum), and the varied kinds of venues for exhibits (museums, trade shows, traveling, nature centers). Students learn through experience and discussion a brief history of museums and exhibitions and discover criteria for informal learning environments that differ from schoolroom learning. This course is an exploration, observation, and theory course. You are asked to visit specific museums: an iconic one of each type. These visits are your primary assignments-sometimes accompanied by a reading. A guest speaker from the assigned museum makes an in-class presentation and receives critiques from we you. In the second half of the course, we begin to reinvent the museum. What is its purpose in the 21st century? How does the need for a curator change? We look at different museums' efforts to use technology to take museums beyond the walls, to expand the notion of curators, to include people who don't have access, or don't know they do, to the places. And though we focus on museums, we also look at exhibits and other public displays of information. This is not a design or production course. The assignments are field trips to museums, readings, and writing. The course is primarily discussion-based, and class participation is a major part of the grade.","instructor":["Hechinger"],"credits":null,"year":2007,"words":[],"group":6},{"id":"course_210,2007","course":"course_210","title":"Industrial Design Workshop","description":"The objective of this workshop is to make more beautiful things.

Giving your idea over to users from the very beginning can improve both the quality of your application and the speed at which it develops. To that end, the course familiarizes students with rapid prototyping techniques rather than following a more traditional semester-long design process, and it is best suited to students seeking experience examining live usage of their concepts. Students form teams to design and launch a prototype built for a small core group of people they personally care about, who collectively approve and participate in each project at every stage. The core group may include both classmates and outside participants who already know each other and the creator(s) well enough to be invested in, and help to determine the direction of, the application. At the rapid design stage students are encouraged to restate flaws as features, promote self-interest and obscure topics, put forward solutions in search of problems, force concepts onto seemingly unsuitable technologies, all with the goal of putting something out to be used as quickly as possible by the core group. By the midterm, team projects are expected to be already in use and ready to be deployed. Teams continue to collect feedback from the core group and iterate while the project is live. As the project scope expands, teams spend the second half of the course studying the social effects of changing audiences, applying techniques to study usage rates and \"stickiness,\" acquiring user feedback automatically, and directing users to newly added features. Teams open the prototypes up to new users, identify and circumvent flaws, add user customization and recruitment tools, and may even combine or adapt features from other teams.

If you were to turn to a fellow student and say, \"I do\" or \"I sentence you to five years in prison,\" your listener would not become your spouse or be hustled off to Rikers. Nothing happens during a wedding or a sentencing hearing; those events are just special forms of talking. Yet talking, in those circumstances, creates real change in the world. There are two nested effects here-the inner one is the conditions under which speech becomes action, and the outer one is the ways we give groups the power to enforce those actions. Social software creates novel contexts for groups, but currently operates outside traditional social support for group action. For example, both corporations and online groups can have high degrees of internal cohesion and strive for external effects on the world, but corporations have the blessing of society, as an official \"legal fiction,\" to take actions that ordinary groups, no matter how cohesive, are forbidden to take. That gap is mainly one of tradition-one can readily imagine alternate \"legal fictions\" to support alternate kinds of groups. This course is centered around weekly readings and class discussions of primary materials, some historical, some current, revolving around four questions: What effect does social software have on groups who want to take action in the world? How do groups come to binding decisions about the action they want to take? What are the traditional supports and constraints for real-world groups (corporations, governments, NGOs, etc.) that act on the world? And what new forms of social support can we imagine for groups that are mainly or solely organized online? The course features readings from political and economic theory of group action, the social structure of engaged (as opposed to merely conversational) groups, and field observations of realworld groups using social software. Students are expected to keep a weekly journal, to write midterm and final papers on groups trying to use social software to effect real change in the world. Note: This course is politically neutral.

Even very inexpensive computers are now fast enough to not only record frames of video but also to look through the individual pixels.

Video tracking in real time requires a coding parsimony that can be used as a challenging method to improve a student's overall coding skills. The course uses Java in the Eclipse environment, which is a good next step from the Processing environment. We look at implementing these techniques across platforms, including the desktop, the cell phone, and even on a microcontroller.

The computer provides artists with a bewildering variety of options for creating images: image editors, 3D modeling tools, animation tools, and dozens of programming languages. Yet at the lower level of all computer rendering lies a relatively simple and very powerful graphics processor. OpenGL provides access to this lower level of rendering and gives artists the opportunity to create their own \"brush and canvas\" to produce high-performance animated graphics in both 3D and 2D. The purpose of this course is to introduce OpenGL and provide a working knowledge of this powerful API. We use Java, Eclipse, and an OpenGL library to explore basic concepts of OpenGL such as coordinate systems, navigating in a 3D space, cameras, rendering models, mouse and keyboard input, lighting, texturing, and blending. The course consists of weekly programming assignments and a final project.

The tools and methods covered in this course can be applied to any platform, from screen based applications to physical computing projects to interactive environments. The course touches on a wide range of design disciplines (graphic design, information design, product design) as they relate to the creation of compelling interactive user experiences. The course is divided into three sections: principles, context, and systems. It takes a heuristic approach to interactive design. Students work through a series of discrete design exercises covering basic concepts such as affordance, feedback and modality. These exercises cover different types of interactive experiences, from simple, appliance-like design problems to dense information systems. Students gain a hands-on understanding of how to combine physical controls and screen-based design elements to support different types of interactions. In the second section, students acquire the tools and methods to conduct primary research with end-users, deriving relevant insights from direct observational research to shape their design solutions. In the final section, we look at some of the prevailing models for interactive systems, drawing from gaming, Web 2.0, and pervasive computing.

The use of motion capture has increased in popularity, due to recent technological advances, and due to increased demand in entertainment, computer animation, visual input for new human-computer-interfaces, and scientific applications. Students discover how to use motion capture for computer animation and all the enthusiasm that it currently sparks. The course introduces students to the use of state-of-the-art, marker- and vision-based motion capture setups, working with dancers. As part of an effort to explore and understand motion from an artistic and from a scientific point of view, Chris Bregler (http://movement.nyu.edu) and Jean-Marc Gauthier (www.tinkering.net) introduce students to the exciting and sometimes controversial art of capturing and re-creating motion of living creatures. We look at designing motion and the ability to create the illusion of life as applied to the expressions and the styles of a person or character. Students gain hands-on experience with a motion capture setup that can measure full-body movements from dancers (for example, the Pilobolus Dance Company), facial expressions from actors, or motions of animals. Students also explore the history of motion with recordings going back to Marey and Muybridge in the late 19th century and early applications of rotoscoping dating back to animated features like Disney's Snow White. Special emphasis is placed on creating interactive storytelling involving interactive character animation using Alias Maya, Alias MotionBuilder, and Virtools.

On the other hand, going past conscious control can be associated with achieving virtuosity in the arts and athletics, acquiring insight into your personality, and engendering trust in conversation. In this course, students build on software and hardware tool kits to create hands-on experiments tapping less conscious parts of our experience. Initial topics include using a cell phone as personal sensor logger and visualizing the results; capturing subtle body language (e.g., eye-tracking) and transmitting it over a network; triggering and detecting subconscious activity (e.g., EEG); and the transition from communication to expression.

The point of this two-point seminar is to research and discuss how these issues relate to our work in interaction design and digital media production and to determine how the ITP community can have the most positive impact. In order to limit the scope of our research to something manageable within the semester, we focus mainly on environmental issues, starting with these central questions: What can we change here and now? What impact do our practices have on the environment, and what changes can we make to lessen the damage we do and increase any positive effects our work has? What skills or ideas do we bring to the table that can have the best effect? What are the most important things for a long-range sustainability program at ITP to focus on?

Or in contrast, can an abundance of technical know-how cloud a simple vision? The goal of this course is to make work that is fueled by the positive constraints (our audience, our vision) rather then the damaging ones (our lack of ability to know everything about the tools we use). Through weekly assignments, we draw ideas and production techniques from art, game design, music (sound art), cognitive science, and universal design toward an understanding of how to carry our initial ideas through a development process, without compromising quality and clarity of vision. For a final assignment, students are asked to create a project for a specific target audience defined by age/gender/race/culture and ability, The goal is to allow oneself a space for exploration while working toward a focused result. Some ideas for projects may include simplifying an application for the growing elderly population (can grandmama really use that fancy Nokia phone?), a software game based solely on audio (ever played Doom without a monitor in a dark room?), or an art piece that clearly conveys your artistic intentions with a digital medium (think of interactive art that's not utterly frustrating/annoying for gallery goers).

Using 3D printing, laser cutting, and milling, we develop a language of \"making\" that can be brought to bear on two different scales: product and display wall. The seminar works within various scripting and modeling environments as a means to both work with form and translate form into real-world artifacts. Rather than take the world of objects at face value, we seek to develop transferable ways of working with form to actively question the shape and usage of mass-produced objects. As a starting point, we break down the world of \"making\" into certain procedures (i.e., perforating, extruding, folding) and extend the potential within each in a simple three-dimensional piece, a \"monad\"-or indivisible unit. This language, as well as the qualities that emerge from the physical model, is then questioned in its correlation to existing objects. After developing an extremely acute formal language within this procedure, the student is challenged to pair it with a means of accumulation/assemblage (i.e., stacking, gluing, tabbing, nesting) that can negotiate a scale-shift from product scale to a display wall. We wish to emphasize the relation to the idea of algorithmic development (i.e., a simple unit that is \"grown\" or repetitively made) is partially brought about through the simplistic operation of CNC prototyping equipment in the sense that they incrementally cut, deposit, or remove material. We do not focus on the \"natural\" or \"biomorphic\" aspects of this, but rather look at how these operations are deployed in objects all around us. The question is how an increased sophistication of design can be gained from the loosened constraints of mass standardization that these machines afford.","instructor":["Collins","Hasegawa"],"credits":null,"year":2007,"words":["biomorphic,2007"],"group":14},{"id":"course_267,2007","course":"course_267","title":"Massively Multiuser Media","description":"With the rise of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game and the development of user-created \"avachat\" environments such as Second Life, There.com, and others, we are witnessing the advent of a vast new canvas for media creators to fill.

Do they represent a shift away from an individualistic to a communal civic culture? Does this signify a nascent ‘information society’ dependent on an ‘information state’ to regulate phenomenon such as ‘net neutrality’? Information Contours explores the nature of the information flows that are generated by evolving, innovating, IT and the role of an emerging ‘information state’. For example, will the current economic crisis, with its collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps, signal the onset of new digital economic information tools that will be government mandated to track risk and verify financial products?

Particular attention is given to social and community- based Web interaction. The production environment consists of the MySQL database and the PHP programming language. Students are expected to develop a firm knowledge of database design and optimization, the SQL query language, and the use of PHP to create dynamic activity of both orthodox and unorthodox nature. Late-semester topics focus on interfacing this environment with other technologies such as JavaScript and Flash, along with data population and site architecture methodology. Introduction to Computational Media or equivalent programming experience is required. Students are also expected to have fluency in HTML or to come up to speed with it outside of class.

In particular, networks exhibit emergent characteristics that cannot be explained simply by examining their constituent parts. People are not like computers, but networks of people and networks of computers are alike in many ways. It is the organization of the respective networks that creates those similarities. Network Effects is a course about the structure of networks and how that structure affects human experience. We focus in particular on two invisible networks—communications networks and social networks. Communications networks are invisible in the traditional sense; their inner workings are hidden from us. We examine a variety of communications networks and explore the ways different networks affect the experiences of their users. Social networks are invisible in a different way; because we are so immersed in myriad social networks— friends, family, work, school—we don’t see them. We examine some of the structural elements of social networks, such as strong and weak ties, clustering, and small-worlds networks, to understand some of the ways that the shape of social networks affects us. The goal of the course is to synthesize observations about these two types of networks. Technological choices embodied in electronic networks profoundly affect their social dimensions: Why can we CC people on email but not on phone calls? How does the one-way network of television differ from the two-way network of the Internet? What effect does BitTorrent’s architectural decentralization have on its users? Social choices also affect the design of technology; resistance to spamming or attempts to hide from the RIAA have led to several deep technological changes in the design of blogs and file-sharing networks, respectively, changes that alter the social relations among the users. The class meetings center on discussion of readings and lectures. Outside class, students complete two short papers, a midterm project, and a final paper or project. The midterm project involves designing and implementing a small network (though not necessarily a computer-mediated one) and describing its effects. The final is a project or research interest of the student’s choice and involves designing, building, and describing a network; a visual and descriptive analysis of an existing network; or a research paper.","instructor":["Shirky"],"credits":null,"year":2009,"words":[],"group":9},{"id":"course_169,2009","course":"course_169","title":"Embedding Privacy","description":"Numerous commentators have pronounced the loss of, and end to, privacy. To protect privacy, the ranks of experts, foundations, and watchdog groups expand. There is a growing tension between the economic needs of digital commerce and expectations of privacy as articulated by privacy advocates. What is “privacy”? This course traces and questions whether the historical notion of privacy is adequate to champion individual autonomy in an interactive digital age. The course examines how privacy is increasingly encompassed by information technology. Various computing applications have been proposed, and in some cases implemented, that have the potential of being invasive of privacy such as RFID and the successors to governmental programs such as Total Information Awareness. Is it possible to address privacy concerns with intelligent design of core technologies? What are the privacy issues connected with biometrics, smart cards, data-mining, and pattern analysis? Is privacy an effective or adequate notion for protecting personal information? This course analyzes how in various technical, legal, and political ways, privacy is incapacitated and lost. The course offers new approaches to thinking about what privacy is and what information autonomy means. Privacy is analyzed in terms of existing policies of restraint in contrast to the next generation of embedded privacy. This includes notions such as embedding information autonomy via computing architecture and building privacy parameters into the cyborg imaginary.

Along the way, they learn techniques for making synchronous TCP and UDP, connections, formatting, compressing and parsing data, client/server and peer-to-peer architectures, connecting with physical computing devices, and real-time analysis and synthesis of video images. Another goal of this course is for students to learn to program using Java. Java basics are covered “as needed” for the specific networking techniques covered.

It is an act of choreographing a series of events in the others’ mind. How is it different from, for example, making a movie? In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and “spoon-fed” to the audience (at least on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product’s functionality/ experience. Here, the user’s experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This course explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, students redesign an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, they design a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality.

Designing such software is a problem that cannot be attacked in the same way as designing a word processor; designers of social software have more in common with economists or political scientists than they do with designers of single-user software, and operators of communal resources have more in common with politicians or landlords than with operators of ordinary Web sites.

Who would be there? What would its main purpose be? Before you answer that question, let’s take a look back. The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside— amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go. The public was very limited; children were usually not allowed in. They were elitist institutions whose mission was archiving the past. Today, although most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors, there are fundamental ways—attitudes, techniques, structural issues—that are still lodged in the 19th century. Now, because of a very different kind of Cabinet of Wonder, i.e., the computer and other IT technologies, museums are able to display collections, demonstrate concepts, and reach their audiences in new ways. Most have not taken full advantage of these new tools or had the time to explore how they might change the nature of a museum visit, but we do in this course. We document together the ways in which technology may enhance the museum experience. We evaluate the use of interactive technologies in museums and how that experience might be extended online. But first we observe and study what they do now. We cannot invent a new wheel before we understand the old one. In this course, we explore the different kinds of exhibits in museums (object-based collection, demonstrations of phenomena), historic or single topic museums (e.g., the Tenement Museum), and the varied kinds of venues for exhibits (museums, trade shows, traveling, nature centers). Students learn through experience and discussion a brief history of museums and exhibitions and discover criteria for informal learning environments that differ from schoolroom learning. This course is an exploration, observation, and theory course. You are asked to visit specific museums: an iconic one of each type. These visits are your primary assignments—sometimes accompanied by a reading. A guest speaker from the assigned museum makes an in-class presentation and receives critiques from you. In the second half of the course, we begin to reinvent the museum. What is its purpose in the 21st century? How does the need for a curator change? We look at different museums’ efforts to use technology to take museums beyond the walls, to expand the notion of curators, to include people who don’t have access, or don’t know they do, to the places. And though we focus on museums, we also look at exhibits and other public displays of information. This is not a design or production course. The assignments are field trips to museums, readings, and writing. The course is primarily discussion-based, and class participation is a major part of the grade.","instructor":["Hechinger"],"credits":null,"year":2009,"words":[],"group":6},{"id":"course_210,2009","course":"course_210","title":"Industrial Design Workshop","description":"The objective of this workshop is to make more beautiful things.

How true are representations crafted with data, and who wants or needs to know about scientific results? What do we gain by incorporating scientific data or visualization into our own work? The goal is to cultivate purposeful science communication and to encourage critical responses to scientific and technological practice in modern culture. Over the course of the class, the focus of each student is on a particular area of science and the aim is to become familiar with its process, language, and data. To do this, students get firsthand experience unpacking particular visualizations, by talking with scientists and students of scientific disciplines, and by interviewing members of potential audiences. Who produces and analyses data, and what are they looking for in their results? Who else is interested in understanding data—and in what setting, through what medium or interface? From these direct experiences, students propose their own art/science collisions: using artistic sensibilities and media tools to communicate about the scientific process, contextualize and annotate visualizations, and frame the chosen topic for particular audiences: museum-goers, policy makers, the disabled, teachers, adults, or children. In periodic “science salons,” students discuss their chosen areas of science, associated datasets and visualizations, affiliated scientists, and potential audiences. Students formulate their own approach to communicating information about science, data, and the topics these inform.

Students study a broad range of applications, from simple marketing through online trading, political campaigns, activism, and satire, and discuss the relative ethics of using the same techniques for different purposes. How do Web sites guide users toward the “buy” button? How are viral campaigns launched? How do PowerPoint and Microsoft “spellcheck” influence our thought patterns? How do marketers exploit information to craft persuasive messaging? How does the use of manipulative communications techniques change the quality of the media landscape?

If you were to turn to a fellow student and say, “I do” or “I sentence you to five years in prison,” your listener would not become your spouse or be hustled off to Rikers. Nothing happens during a wedding or a sentencing hearing; those events are just special forms of talking. Yet talking, in those circumstances, creates real change in the world. There are two nested effects here—the inner one is the conditions under which speech becomes action, and the outer one is the ways we give groups the power to enforce those actions. Social software creates novel contexts for groups, but currently operates outside traditional social support for group action. For example, both corporations and online groups can have high degrees of internal cohesion and strive for external effects on the world, but corporations have the blessing of society, as an official “legal fiction,” to take actions that ordinary groups, no matter how cohesive, are forbidden to take. That gap is mainly one of tradition—one can readily imagine alternate “legal fictions” to support alternate kinds of groups. This course is centered around weekly readings and class discussions of primary materials, some historical, some current, revolving around four questions: What effect does social software have on groups who want to take action in the world? How do groups come to binding decisions about the action they want to take? What are the traditional supports and constraints for real-world groups (corporations, governments, NGOs, etc.) that act on the world? And what new forms of social support can we imagine for groups that are mainly or solely organized online? The course features readings from political and economic theory of group action, the social structure of engaged (as opposed to merely conversational) groups, and field observations of real-world groups using social software. Students are expected to keep a weekly journal, to write midterm and final papers on groups trying to use social software to effect real change in the world. Note: This course is politically neutral. The design issues discussed are relevant to both liberal and conservative political actors.

In this course, we apply simple rules to dictate the shape or function of a work, and add to it an inherent complexity that is both beautiful and intelligent. By combining a set of simple rules, or a system, with physical computing, we marry the work to the intention of the artist. This helps us define what we are doing when we create and allows us to take the assignments beyond exercises in executing basic electronics.

Even very inexpensive computers are now fast enough to not only record frames of video but also to look through the individual pixels.

The course is divided into three sections: principles, context, and systems. It takes a heuristic approach to interactive design. Students work through a series of discrete design exercises covering basic concepts such as affordance, feedback, and modality. These exercises cover different types of interactive experiences, from simple, appliancelike design problems to dense information systems. Students gain a hands-on understanding of how to combine physical controls and screen-based design elements to support different types of interactions. In the second section, students acquire the tools and methods to conduct primary research with end-users, deriving relevant insights from direct observational research to shape their design solutions. In the final section, we look at some of the prevailing models for interactive systems, drawing from gaming, Web 2.0, and pervasive computing. Students make use of the knowledge and experience acquired during the course to create a set of interaction design patterns that can be applied to a large-scale interactive system.","instructor":["Fabricant"],"credits":null,"year":2009,"words":["affordance,2009"],"group":19},{"id":"course_244,2009","course":"course_244","title":"Project Development Studio","description":"This is an environment for students to work on their existing project ideas that may fall outside the topic areas of existing courses.

Conventional computer interface tends to accommodate conscious, explicit, intentional communication. Many unconscious cues and actions that are valued in ordinary human expression are ignored or filtered by computer-mediated interactions. On the one hand, relinquishing a conscious gatekeeper can be associated with such uncomfortable subjects as subliminal manipulation, subconscious repression, even a loss of free will and the insanity defense. On the other hand, going past conscious control can be associated with achieving virtuosity in the arts and athletics, acquiring insight into your personality, and engendering trust in conversation. In this course, students build on software and hardware tool kits to create hands-on experiments tapping less conscious parts of our experience. Initial topics include using a cell phone as personal sensor logger and visualizing the results; capturing subtle body language (e.g., eye-tracking) and transmitting it over a network; triggering and detecting subconscious activity (e.g., EEG); and the transition from communication to expression. Throughout the course, we relate these techniques to the advantages of introducing computers at all such as search, storage, and transmission.

Interactivity, the passage of time, and resolution are just a few of the ideas that are being explored. Yet these ideas are new only in the sense that they are being adapted to new media. For example, in painting and sculpture, Renaissance and baroque artists used a variety of means to actively engage the viewer; the concept of continuous narrative, reaching back to the Egyptians, aims to convey the passage of time; and the notion of resolution has been variously interpreted by Titian, Seurat, Cézanne, de Kooning, Close, and many others. This course examines how artists throughout history have utilized various media and techniques to effect formal, conceptual, and experiential dynamics comparable to those being investigated by new media artists today. The goal of the course is not only to provide students with knowledge of the immensely rich history of artistic creativity, but also—and more important—to provide a platform through which that knowledge may be utilized to reconsider new media strategies of artistic expression. Through observation, discussion, reading, and projects (both written and hands-on), students acquire mental tools to approach their own work with an expanded understanding of artistic possibility. This course is not a dry art history survey and is not conducted as such.

These issues fall roughly into three categories: environment and ecology, economic development, and human rights equity. There are massive changes needed in all of these areas. The point of this two-point seminar is to research and discuss how these issues relate to our work in interaction design and digital media production and to determine how the ITP community can have the most positive impact. In order to limit the scope of our research to something manageable within the semester, we focus mainly on environmental issues, starting with these central questions: What can we change here and now? What impact do our practices have on the environment, and what changes can we make to lessen the damage we do and increase any positive effects our work has? What skills or ideas do we bring to the table that can have the best effect? What are the most important things for a long-range sustainability program at ITP to focus on? In looking for answers to these questions, we attempt to address both our practice here at ITP and the assumptions we take with us into work and life after ITP. We build an online resource for ourselves and others based on what we learn in the process. This might include reading lists, suggested actions to be taken, links to sources of useful materials and tools for designers and artists, and to organizations whose work overlaps ours. We implement what changes we can and make suggestions on those that will take longer. For several of the class meetings, guest practitioners from a variety of areas join the class to discuss how their work is affected by these issues. The class is broken into groups of four, and each group is expected to research a given guest’s work and prepare to lead the class conversation with the guest.

Presupposing a relationship between computer code and social codes calls into question the larger nature and value of systems and the means by which one might effectively change them. The political, phenomenological, and practical problems raised by this set of issues form the backdrop for this course, in which we survey tactical media works developed since the 1960s, with an emphasis on work since 1995. We look at artists’ use of a variety of media— including the news media, the Internet, locative media, surveillance techniques, genetic modification, software viruses, memes, live performance, the audience, and more—to carry out protests. We also visit precursors to tactical media, including that which is typically referred to as “protest art” and important media intervention projects. The relationship between the evolution of communication media and the shift in tactics is among our core concerns. We hear from guest lecturers and read a combination of theoretical texts, seminal curatorial statements, manifestos, and mainstream press response to these interventions.

With digital technologies, one other constraint is our own ability to keep up with the ever shifting tools that we use. Does this perpetual learning curve stifle our creative process? Or in contrast, can an abundance of technical know-how cloud a simple vision? The goal of this course is to make work that is fueled by the positive constraints (our audience, our vision) rather then the damaging ones (our lack of ability to know everything about the tools we use). Through weekly assignments, we draw ideas and production techniques from art, game design, music (sound art), cognitive science, and universal design toward an understanding of how to carry our initial ideas through a development process, without compromising quality and clarity of vision. For a final assignment, students are asked to create a project for a specific target audience, defined by age/gender/ race/culture and ability. The goal is to allow oneself a space for exploration while working toward a focused result. Some ideas for projects may include simplifying an application for the growing elderly population (can grandmama really use that fancy Nokia phone?), a software game based solely on audio (ever played Doom without a monitor in a dark room?), or an art piece that clearly conveys your artistic intentions with a digital medium (think of interactive art that’s not utterly frustrating/ annoying for gallery goers). In either case, we test our work early and often (starting midsemester), learn to identify problems, and solve them through an iterative design process. When needed, software examples are programmed using Processing. We also use simple pcomp modules to quicken exploration (such as custom keyboard emulators). A fair understanding of ICM and pcomp is required, as you are asked not to spend the majority of your energy learning new technologies, but rather make the best of what you already know.

The seminar functions as both an introduction to different CNC + prototyping equipment as well as a studio in which to test the possibilities and constraints of these new methods of production. Using 3D printing, laser cutting, and milling, we develop a language of “making” that can be brought to bear on two different scales: product and display wall. The seminar works within various scripting and modeling environments as a means to both work with form and translate form into real-world artifacts. Rather than take the world of objects at face value, we seek to develop transferable ways of working with form to actively question the shape and usage of mass-produced objects. As a starting point, we break down the world of “making” into certain procedures (i.e., perforating, extruding, folding) and extend the potential within each in a simple three-dimensional piece, a “monad”— or indivisible unit. This language, as well as the qualities that emerge from the physical model, is then questioned in its correlation to existing objects. After developing an extremely acute formal language within this procedure, the student is challenged to pair it with a means of accumulation/assemblage (i.e., stacking, gluing, tabbing, nesting) that can negotiate a scale-shift from product scale to a display wall. We wish to emphasize the relation to the idea of algorithmic development (i.e., a simple unit that is “grown” or repetitively made) is partially brought about through the simplistic operation of CNC prototyping equipment in the sense that they incrementally cut, deposit, or remove material. We do not focus on the “natural” or “biomorphic” aspects of this, but rather look at how these operations are deployed in objects all around us.

This course approaches the concept of “media change” from three distinct, interdependent perspectives. First, we consider the social and political forces that compel “media change,” from technological determinism to the ideology of media ecology. Second, we visit the creative genres that respond to media change, including low bit art and music, retro-futurism, remix and open source aesthetics, environmentally- conscious work, and nostalgia-driven work, among others. Finally, we look at the challenges of archiving and preserving new media art, due to its ephemerality and dependence upon dynamic systems. We are visited by artists and preservationists whose practices engage with these questions. The course addresses larger philosophical questions and a lot of fun art, while concerning itself with practical solutions to the challenges (or opportunities) at hand.

The first movies were filmed plays; it took decades for the vocabulary of film and a new kind of storytelling to emerge. Now film is viewable on handheld devices (phones, palms, iPods, MP3 players), and people are watching movies on these devices that are meant for the big screen and a communal experience (theater), or they are watching short-format forms, such as commercials and music videos, which are meant for TV and whose purpose is selling stuff. Will a new art form emerge out of this? Will there be a new vocabulary? Will visuals become less important? Sound more important? Can one be moved to action, to tears, to laughter in a short time and small space? Can one possibly feel immersed? 2X2 is an experiment—a creative storytelling/narrative course exploring a potential new art form, specifically designed to be seen on a small (+/- 2 inches) screen for a short time (+/- 2 minutes). Emphasis is on story, not production, not interaction, not theory. We explore narrative possibilities in both nonfiction (e.g., essay forms, minidocs,) and fiction (e.g., stories, poetry, performance). In some assignments, students work with other people’s stories; in others, they create their own. In a collaboration created for this course, students have access to and permission to use the Magnum Photo archive (www.magnumphotos.com). The class follows a “creative writing” style format. Each week there are two assignments. These are quick sketches/rough drafts; a specific exercise is given at the end of each class, which has two aspects: a topic/theme (e.g., confess to an emotional crime), and a form restriction (e.g., use no words). In each class, students present their work for critique. Every week each student adds an episode, randomly assigned, to someone else’s story created the previous week. For a final project, each student picks two of their individual assignments (one fiction, one nonfiction) to take to a more finished level.

Students are encouraged to imagine the impossible and to integrate meta-forms into the contemporary city. Science fiction sites, transportation paths, urban anomalies, invisible boundaries, and temporary autonomous zone are examined and developed as meta-form habitats. The semester long project is divided into two parts: expressions and interventions. The first section, expressions, addresses contemporary architectural tendencies that unfold to inhabit the spaces of urban environments. The second part, interventions, activates communication strategies to connect the meta-forms to actual public spaces within New York City. The class work culminates in final presentations critiqued by guest reviewers from related fields.

Students explore drawing in whatever medium they choose, it need not be technological— the idea is to generate a “working tool set.” This could mean exploring a certain aspect of MaxMSP or Processing or Arduino for example. The point is that drawing is an oddly physical and intellectual activity—one can’t have one without the other. Can we bring some of this “physicalness” into how we understand our technological tools? Also, can we begin thinking about the sketchbook as a “machine for ideas?” The course is as much about “drawing machines” as it is about developing/refining a creative process.

Even as our technologies become smaller and more versatile, we find ourselves bending down towards our keyboards and screens, and much of what we communicate with our bodies gets lost in translation. In Thinking Physically, we work to open ourselves back up and embrace the rich capabilities and inherent expressiveness of the human form. Starting with the body itself, we think about how it works and take a brief look at motion studies and biomechanics. Next, we examine how we use our bodies to relate to each other, considering physical social perceptions, proxemics, and cultural contexts. We then work to become better listeners, striving to sense the subtleties of body language, gesture, and nonverbal communication. Finally, it’s time to put those listening skills to work, designing interfaces that perceive the body’s communicative nature and encourage people to interact in a more physical way. Thinking Physically is a hands-on workshop in which we get up and move. Students create experiments and prototypes (both conceptual and technical) in response to weekly topics and design a body-centric final project based on what they’ve learned.

This course takes an analytical approach to unraveling and understanding these charged moments. In the process of the studying how and why strangers interact in public, we address some of the abiding themes at ITP— urban behavior, spontaneous interaction, the pleasure of the unexpected, how technology can mediate and/or enable human experience—and we make a close and thorough examination of how they play out in this narrow slice of human experience. This approach is designed to bring students to a more concrete understanding of these larger abstract ideas. Classwork consists of readings, class discussions, field assignments (a series of assigned interactions with strangers that the students document and discuss) and an analytical final paper. Students learn how the interactions of strangers have changed historically (and why), what the experience of interaction with strangers means to the participants, how strangers ‘read’ each other, how they initiate interactions, how they avoid interactions, how they trust each other and how they fool each other. Readings range from seminal works on urban sociology and public behavior (Georg Simmel, Stanley Milgram, Erving Goffman, Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Elijah Anderson) to more lyrical examinations of strangers in cities (Tim Etchells, Italo Calvino, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Edgar Allan Poe) to recent neuropsychiatric discoveries about trust, mimicry, and flash judgments. Because stranger interactions are at heart a means to interrupt the expected narrative of the everyday, we consider the works of artists and thinkers who show how such disruption, surprise, spontaneity, and play are fundamental to the pleasure and substance of urban life, for example: the Situationists and their descendents, Sophie Calle, Marina Abramovic, Francis Alys, Graffiti Research Lab, Robert Rauschenberg, Survival Research Labs.

Through a series of challenges and group exercises, students create prototypes to explore, validate and test ideas. Students should come to this course with a big idea. This is the perfect environment to take on something that has not been done, something risky or difficult to approach. As a class, we work collaboratively to identify, implement and document the process and use of prototypes to further realize the idea and design. Throughout this course, students develop a body of work in the form of sketches, models and semi-functional objects. The value comes not from the volume or quality of what you produce, but rather from what you learn and how you apply that knowledge back into the design.

In this course, we survey the major work that has been done to understand games, both digital and traditional, in the past sixty years. Starting with foundational texts by historian Johan Huizinga and sociologist Roger Caillois, up to the present day where movements like ‘New Games Journalism’ seek to place games in the more personal context of a single human life.

As the available inputs and UI change with each device, so does the content, design limitations, and the narrative. We currently live in a world where we interact with content in three main environments: one foot—cell phone/iPod, two foot—computer, and 10-foot—television and with each of these devices we have to accommodate our content and interaction accordingly, and allow for the content to follow the user between these devices, but maintain a classic and intuitive user experience.

Furthermore, we examine the power of persuasive technologies in creating opportunities for communicating non-human intentions and viewpoints. Readings range from Douglas Adams on Genuine People Personalities, to Frank Herbert’s Without Me, You’re Nothing, Friedrich Juenger’s The Failure of Technology, to BJ Fogg, Nass, and Rives, and the work in Critical Design by Dunne and Raby, among others.

Do they represent a shift away from an individualistic to a communal civic culture? Does this signify a nascent ‘information society’ dependent on an information state' to regulate phenomenon such as ‘net neutrality’? Information Contours explores the nature of the information flows that are generated by evolving, innovating, IT and the role of an emerging ‘information state’. For example, will the current economic crisis, with its collateralized debt obligations and unit default swaps, signal the onset of new digital economic information tools that will be government mandated to track risk and verify financial products?

Students work in small teams to evolve their ideas from concept through design documentation to proof-of-concept. Each team presents a working prototype of an interactive media system for a public space at the end of the semester. Throughout the course, students learn basic project management skills that aid in the realization of innovative ideas. Weekly discussions briefly cover topical subjects such as tangible user interfaces, alternative feedback devices, wireless computing environments, and hybrid interactive systems that tie physical spaces to the Internet.

Particular attention is given to social and community-based Web interaction. The production environment consists of the MySQL database and the PHP programming language. Students are expected to develop a firm knowledge of database design and optimization, the SQL query language, and the use of PHP to create dynamic activity of both orthodox and unorthodox nature.

No, but the long-term outcomes of present-day actions can be foreseen and, as the 2008 economic crisis showed us, lack of foresight can have grave implications. Using a technique called scenario planning, students consider the present and future ramifications of knotty, large scale problems related to the evolution of the internet and other aspects of the telecommunications infrastructure. In exploring this, we touch upon the global economy, demographics, international politics, environmental concerns, and other large-scale issues. Scenario planning is a rigorous but highly engaging technique, in which people share information and judgment to create a picture of the future larger than any individual could produce alone. The technique has been used since the mid-1950s decades to distinguish certainties from uncertainties, and to learn to be prepared for multiple eventualities. Students will conduct original research on significant trends, use those trends to develop compelling, plausible stories about possible futures, and present the futures-and the strategies they suggest-to a public audience.

We understand intuitively that networked computers differ from stand-alone computers, or that a group of friends differs from an aggregation of anonymous individuals, but describing that difference clearly is difficult. In particular, networks exhibit emergent characteristics that cannot be explained simply by examining their constituent parts. People are not like computers, but networks of people and networks of computers are alike in many ways. It is the organization of the respective networks that creates those similarities. Network Effects is a course about the structure of networks and how that structure affects human experience. We focus in particular on two invisible networks-communications networks and social networks. Communications networks are invisible in the traditional sense; their inner workings are hidden from us. We examine a variety of communications networks and explore the ways different networks affect the experiences of their users. Social networks are invisible in a different way; because we are so immersed in myriad social networks-friends, family, work, school-we don't see them. We examine some of the structural elements of social networks, such as strong and weak ties, clustering, and small-worlds networks, to understand some of the ways that the shape of social networks affects us. The goal of the course is to synthesize observations about these two types of networks. Technological choices embodied in electronic networks profoundly affect their social dimensions: Why can we CC people on email but not on phone calls? How does the one-way network of television differ from the two-way network of the Internet? What effect does BitTorrent's architectural decentralization have on its users? Social choices also affect the design of technology; resistance to spamming or attempts to hide from the RIAA have led to several deep technological changes in the design of blogs and file-sharing networks, respectively, changes that alter the social relations among the users. The class meetings center on discussion of readings and lectures. Outside class students complete two short papers, a midterm project, and a final paper or project. The midterm project involves designing and implementing a small network (though not necessarily a computer-mediated one) and describing its effects. The final is a project or research interest of the student's choice and involves designing, building, and describing a network; a visual and descriptive analysis of an existing network; or a research paper.","instructor":["Shirky"],"credits":null,"year":2011,"words":[],"group":9},{"id":"course_169,2011","course":"course_169","title":"Embedding Privacy","description":"Numerous commentators have pronounced the loss of, and end to, privacy. To protect privacy, the ranks of experts, foundations, and watchdog groups expand. There is a growing tension between the economic needs of digital commerce and expectations of privacy as articulated by privacy advocates. What is \"privacy\"? This course traces and questions whether the historical notion of privacy is adequate to champion individual autonomy in an interactive digital age. The course examines how privacy is increasingly encompassed by information technology. Various computing applications have been proposed, and in some cases implemented, that have the potential of being invasive of privacy such as RFID and the successors to governmental programs such as Total Information Awareness. Is it possible to address privacy concerns with intelligent design of core technologies? What are the privacy issues connected with biometrics, smart cards, data-mining, and pattern analysis? Is privacy an effective or adequate notion for protecting personal information? This course analyzes how in various technical, legal, and political ways, privacy is incapacitated and lost. The course offers new approaches to thinking about what privacy is and what information autonomy means. Privacy is analyzed in terms of existing policies of restraint in contrast to the next generation of embedded privacy. This includes notions such as embedding information autonomy via computing architecture and building privacy parameters into the cyborg imaginary. This course lends itself to one of ITP's great assets: creativity. Students develop a conceptual understanding of privacy as an identity platform upon which can be embedded the architecture of digital autonomy.","instructor":["Libarle"],"credits":null,"year":2011,"words":[],"group":14},{"id":"course_337,2011","course":"course_337","title":"Networked Expression","description":"In an ordinary conversation, a person's body language registers as much as his or her spoken language.

Along the way, they learn techniques for making synchronous TCP and UDP, connections, formatting, compressing and parsing data, client/server and peer-to-peer architectures, connecting with physical computing devices, and real-time analysis and synthesis of video images. Another goal of this course is for students to learn to program using Java. Java basics are covered “as needed” for the specific networking techniques covered.

It is an act of choreographing a series of events in the others' mind. How is it different from, for example, making a movie? In the case of linear narrative media, such as music, film, and novel, an experience is predetermined by the maker and \"spoon-fed\" to the audience (at least on the mechanical level of perception). However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product's functionality/experience. Here, the user's experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This course explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, students redesign an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, they design a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality. Students are encouraged to explore new 2 vocabulary of interactivity, to expand the lexicon of interactive experience, and to examine the societal role of designing experience.","instructor":["Udagawa"],"credits":null,"year":2011,"words":["choreographing,2011"],"group":19},{"id":"course_186,2011","course":"course_186","title":"Dynamic Bodies","description":"We take the beauty of the dynamic world around us for granted.

Assignments include sketching out proposals for new work-storyboarding, for example-building a visual vocabulary through various forms of improvisation, as well as the more conventional practice of drawing from the model and still life. Students bring their knowledge of interactive telecommunications to drawing and find ways to let drawing enter into their design work. In this introductory drawing class students are urged to draw anything they want, exploring the freedom of expression that comes from playing with one's imagination and memory and creating convincing imagery with or without references.

Designing such software is a problem that cannot be attacked in the same way as designing a word processor; designers of social software have more in common with economists or political scientists than they do with designers of single-user software, and operators of communal resources have more in common with politicians or landlords than with operators of ordinary Web sites.

Who would be there? What would its main purpose be? Before you answer that question, let's take a look back. The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside-amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go. The public was very limited; children were usually not allowed in. They were elitist institutions whose mission was archiving the past. Today, although most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors, there are fundamental ways-attitudes, techniques, structural issues-that are still lodged in the 19th century. Now, because of a very different kind of Cabinet of Wonder, i.e., the computer and other IT technologies, museums are able to display collections, demonstrate concepts, and reach their audiences in new ways. Most have not taken full advantage of these new tools or had the time to explore how they might change the nature of a museum visit, but we do in this course. We document together the ways in which technology may enhance the museum experience. We evaluate the use of interactive technologies in museums and how that experience might be extended online. But first we observe and study what they do now. We cannot invent a new wheel before we understand the old one. In this course, we explore the different kinds of exhibits in museums (object-based collection, demonstrations of phenomena), historic or single topic museums (e.g., the Tenement Museum), and the varied kinds of venues for exhibits (museums, trade shows, traveling, nature centers). Students learn through experience and discussion a brief history of museums and exhibitions and discover criteria for informal learning environments that differ from schoolroom learning. This course is an exploration, observation, and theory course. You are asked to visit specific museums: an iconic one of each type These visits are your primary assignnents-sometimes accompanied by a reading. A guest speaker from the assigned museum makes an in-class presentation and receives critiques from you. In the second half of the course, we begin to reinvent the museum. What is its purpose in the 21st century? How does the need for a curator change? We look at different museums' efforts to use technology to take museums beyond the walls, to expand the notion of curators, to include people who don't have access, or don't know they do, to the places. And though we focus on museums, we also look at exhibits and other public displays of information. This is not a design or production course.

Broadcast is being pushed in new directions by the increasing ease of producing compelling material and by the interactive and social nature of the Internet. Blogs and other Internet-based social networks have given rise to an audience that is eager to engage with and participate in the creation of media. This appetite is quickly moving into the realm of television and radio with new avenues for distribution and new means for audience interaction, offering serious challenges to traditional broadcast. The goal of this course is to introduce students to new technologies and methods for creating participatory media and making it available. Students develop new ideas for helping this transition along both on the Internet and in the traditional broadcast space.

What does it mean to use the \"scientific method\"? What is the purpose and value of data produced in experiments? How true are representations crafted with data, and who wants or needs to know about scientific results? What do we gain by incorporating scientific data or visualization into our own work? The goal is to cultivate purposeful science communication and to encourage critical responses to scientific and technological practice in modern culture. Over the course of the class, the focus of each student is on a particular area of science and the aim is to become familiar with its process, language, and data. To do this, students get firsthand experience unpacking particular visualizations, by talking with scientists and students of scientific disciplines, and by interviewing members of potential audiences. Who produces and analyses data, and what are they looking for in their results? Who else is interested in understanding data-and in what setting, through what medium or interface? From these direct experiences, students propose their own art/science collisions: using artistic sensibilities and media tools to communicate about the scientific process, contextualize and annotate visualizations, and frame the chosen topic for particular audiences: museumgoers, policy makers, the disabled, teachers, adults, or children. In periodic “science salons,” students discuss their chosen areas of science, associated datasets and visualizations, affiliated scientists, and potential audiences. Students formulate their own approach to communicating information about science, data, and the topics these inform. Students storyboard three separate explanatory presentations of the data in his or her selected area, each with a separate approach, designed for a unique audience.

These include e-mail, the Web, and cell phones, as well as integrated marketing, \"one-to-one\" communication, viral media, hacktivism, and neuromarketing. Students study a broad range of applications, from simple marketing through online trading, political campaigns, activism, and satire, and discuss the relative ethics of using the same techniques for different purposes. How do Web sites guide users toward the \"buy\" button? How are viral campaigns launched? How do PowerPoint and Microsoft \"spell-check' influence our thought patterns? How do marketers exploit information to craft persuasive messaging? How does the use of manipulative communications techniques change the quality of the media landscape? How do today's online selling techniques fit into a history of salesmanship and marketing? How do wireless companies hope to get ads on our cell phones?

If you were to turn to a fellow student and say, \"I do\" or \"I sentence you to five years in prison,\" your listener would not become your spouse or be hustled off to Rikers. Nothing happens during a wedding or a sentencing hearing; those events are just special forms of talking. Yet talking, in those circumstances, creates real change in the world. There are two nested effects here-the inner one is the conditions under which speech becomes action, and the outer one is the ways we give groups the power to enforce those actions. Social software creates novel contexts for groups, but currently operates outside traditional social support for group action. For example, both corporations and online groups can have high degrees of internal cohesion and strive for external effects on the world, but corporations have the blessing of society, as an official \"legal fiction,\" to take actions that ordinary groups, no matter how cohesive, are forbidden to take. That gap is mainly one of tradition-on can readily imagine alternate \"legal fictions\" to support alternate kinds of groups. This course is centered around weekly readings and class discussions of primary materials, some historical, some current, revolving around four questions What effect does social software have on groups who want to take action in the world? How do groups come to binding decisions about the action they want to take? What are the traditional supports and constraints for real-world groups (corporations, governments, NGOs, etc.) that act on the world? And what new forms of social support can we imagine for groups that are mainly or solely organized online? The course features readings from political and economic theory of group action, the social structure of engaged (as opposed to merely conversational) groups, and field observations of real-world groups using social software. Students are expected to keep a weekly journal, to write midterm and final papers on groups trying to use social software to effect real change in the world. Note: This course is politically neutral.

Our goal is to expand the palette of interaction design to more fully engage our sensory apparatus. A particular focus is on the aesthetic possibilities of such multisensory design. We look at our senses in various combinations, examining how they closely interact and relate with one another.

The course begins with a review of the electronics of sensor systems as learned in physical computing. From there, students discuss types of sensors; sensors, time, and events; amplification and filtering of sensor signals; sensor networks; and related topics that aid in making sensor systems effective. There are a number of one-week exercises that students complete to demonstrate the techniques discussed in class. In addition, students are responsible for a major sensor research project in which they explain the operating principles of a given sensor and present a working example of the sensor in use.

How can one remain in control of one's identity in that future? This course creates a framework to help students not only analyze existing technology, but also to help them think more deeply about their own projects. Students review current technologies such as Internet protocols, cellular networks, and RFID; they also get hands-on experience in both using these technologies and hacking them.

Sending an instant message? Opening a laptop to sign onto the wireless network at Starbucks? Maybe. Clicking on a Web page records your IP address on a Web server somewhere, instant messages are usually sent off unencrypted over the network, and opening a laptop usually requires negotiation with a DHCP server that records your computer's unique identifier. Our devices and our online interactions leave a mark as unique as our fingerprints; thus, relevant questions are how can we turn those tables?

Generative art creates a process of evolution. Where most art imitates life, generative art has a life of its own. Generative methods have been chained to the personal computer for too long. The course asks the question, what would happen if we took the algorithms employed in software art and applied them to the physical world through sensors and reactive elements? Or, as in Ned Kahn's piece \"Wind,\" what if we were to apply laws of nature to physical works? In this course, we apply simple rules to dictate the shape or function of a work, and add to it an inherent complexity that is both beautiful and intelligent. By combining a set of simple rules, or a system, with physical computing, we marry the work to the intention of the artist. This helps us define what we are doing when we create and allows us to take the assignments beyond exercises in executing basic electronics. Living art extracts the generative approach from the personal computer and applies it to the physical world.

It is natural that we try to emulate this on a computer. As a sensor the video camera is appealing, delivering up to 36 million bytes every second compared to maybe three bytes from a keyboard. Accessories and knowledge for using cameras are mainstream. For instance, by simply changing lenses, the same sensor once used for your fingers can now be aimed at a city block. Even very inexpensive computers are now fast enough to not only record frames of video but also to look through the individual pixels. It is no wonder cameras have become a standard accessory for computers (especially in cell phones). The difficulty of computer vision comes when you expect your software to be able to mimic the powers of the human brain to interpret arbitrary images. This course attempts to sidestep the difficult parts if you are willing to work in fairly contrived environments such as art installations, eye tracking rigs, or ant farms. The course covers software techniques for tracking objects in video, background removal, blob detection, as well as tricks on the optical side of the equation. Video tracking in real time requires a coding parsimony that can be used as a challenging method to improve a student's overall coding skills.

Interactivity, the passage of time, and resolution are just a few of the ideas that are being explored. Yet these ideas are new only in the sense that they are being adapted to new media. For example, in painting and sculpture, Renaissance and baroque artists used a variety of means to actively engage the viewer; the concept of continuous narrative, reaching back to the Egyptians, aims to convey the passage of time; and the notion of resolution has been variously interpreted by Titian, Seurat, Cezanne, de Kooning, Close, and many others. This course examines how artists throughout history have utilized various media and techniques to effect formal, conceptual, and experiential dynamics comparable to those being investigated by new media artists today. The goal of the course is not only to provide students with knowledge of the immensely rich history of artistic creativity, but also-and more important-to provide a platform through which that knowledge may be utilized to reconsider new media strategies of artistic expression. Through observation, discussion, reading, and projects (both written and hands-on), students acquire mental tools to approach their own work with an expanded understanding of artistic possibility. This course is not a dry art history survey and is not conducted as such. Organized thematically, rather than chronologically, the focus of each class is on a different concept derived from the field of new media production and examined with regard to artistic precedents.

These issues fall roughly into three categories: environment and ecology, economic development, and human rights equity There are massive changes needed in all of these areas. The point of this two-unit seminar is to research and discuss how these issues relate to our work in interaction design and digital media production and to determine how the ITP community can have the most positive impact. In order to limit the scope of our research to something manageable within the semester, we focus mainly on environmental issues, starting with these central questions: What can we change here and now? What impact do our practices have on the environment, and what changes can we make to lessen the damage we do and increase any positive effects our work has? What skills or ideas do we bring to the table that can have the best effect? What are the most important things for a long-range sustainability program at ITP to focus on? In looking for answers to these questions, we attempt to address both our practice here at ITP and the assumptions we take with us into work and life after ITP. We build an online resource for ourselves and others based on what we learn in the process. This might include reading lists, suggested actions to be taken, links to sources of useful materials and tools for designers and artists, and to organizations whose work overlaps ours. We implement what changes we can and make suggestions on those that will take longer. For several of the class meetings, guest practitioners from a variety of areas join the class to discuss how their work is affected by these issues. The class is broken into groups of four, and each group is expected to research a given guest's work and prepare to lead the class conversation with the guest.

With digital technologies, one other constraint is our own ability to keep up with the ever-shifting tools that we use. Does this perpetual learning curve stifle our creative process? Or in contrast, can an abundance of technical know-how cloud a simple vision? The goal of this course is to make work that is fueled by the positive constraints (our audience, our vision) rather than the damaging ones (our lack of ability to know everything about the tools we use). Through weekly assignments, we draw ideas and production techniques from art, game design, music (sound art), cognitive science, and universal design toward an understanding of how to carry our initial ideas through a development process, without compromising quality and clarity of vision. For a final assignment, students are asked to create a project for a specific target audience, defined by age/gender/race/culture and ability. The goal is to allow oneself a space for exploration while working toward a focused result. Some ideas for projects may include simplifying an application for the growing elderly population (can grandmama really use that fancy Nokia phone?), a software game based solely on audio (ever played Doom without a monitor in a dark room?), or an art piece that clearly conveys your artistic intentions with a digital medium (think of interactive art that's not utterly frustrating/annoying for gallery goers) In either case, we test our work early and often (starting midsemester), learn to identify problems, and solve them through an iterative design process. When needed, software examples are programmed using Processing. We also use simple pcomp modules to quicken exploration (such as custom keyboard emulators). A fair understanding of ICM and pcomp is required, as you are asked not to spend the majority of your energy learning new technologies, but rather make the best of what you already know.

The seminar functions as both an introduction to different CNC prototyping equipment as well as a studio in which to test the possibilities and constraints of these new methods of production Using 3D printing, laser cutting, and milling, we develop a language of \"making\" that can be brought to bear on two different scales: product and display wall. The seminar works within various scripting and modeling environments as a means to both work with form and translate form into real-world artifacts. Rather than take the world of objects at face value, we seek to develop transferable ways of working with form to actively question the shape and usage of mass-produced objects. As a starting point, we break down the world of \"making\" into certain procedures (i.e., perforating, extruding, folding) and extend the potential within each in a simple three dimensional piece, a \"monad\"-or indivisible unit. This language, as well as the qualities that emerge from the physical model, is then questioned in its correlation to existing objects. After developing an extremely acute formal language within this procedure, the student is challenged to pair it with a means of accumulation/assemblage (i.e., stacking, gluing, tabbing, nesting) that can negotiate a scale-shift from product scale to a display wall. We wish to emphasize the relation to the idea of algorithmic development (i.e., a simple unit that is \"grown\" or repetitively made) is partially brought about through the simplistic operation of CNC prototyping equipment in the sense that they incrementally cut, deposit, or remove material. We do not focus on the \"natural\" or \"biomorphic\" aspects of this, but rather look at how these operations are deployed in objects all around us.

During the course, students research the social issues related to their design challenge: why does this problem exist, how common is this situation, and how does individual design differ from inclusive or universal design? As projects progress students are asked to generalize their solutions and define how a larger population might use their designs. The goal of the course is to bring student designers together with people in the community who need a specific one-off working solution that is used by the individual and documented to share with similar organizations.

If we can only perceive these things through mediation (media representations), then how we represent them is the fundamental question, reflecting our ideologies, prejudices, hopes, and fears. Do we speak for animals, and if so what are we saying for them? Are they friends, pets, environmental equals, or beasts? How are hybrid monsters (chimera) created and what do they mean? How do we understand our places as subjects in a landscape or a datascape? How can anthropomorphic cuteness be subversive? This course focuses on questions of intention, relation, and subjectivity, through critical engagement with representations of people, animals, monsters, and mutants, in their respective environments. The class is further focused on the use of character in context, via toy design, robotics, animation, video, image generation, or data visualization.

Even as our technologies become smaller and more versatile, we find ourselves bending down towards our keyboards and screens, and much of what we communicate with our bodies gets lost in translation. In Thinking Physically, we work to open ourselves back up and embrace the rich capabilities and inherent expressiveness of the human form. Starting with the body itself, we think about how it works and take a brief look at motion studies and biomechanics. Next, we examine how we use our bodies to relate to each other, considering physical social perceptions, proxemics, and cultural contexts. We then work to become better listeners, striving to sense the subtleties of body language, gesture, and nonverbal communication. Finally, it's time to put those listening skills to work, designing interfaces that perceive the body's communicative nature and encourage people to interact in a more physical way. Thinking Physically is a hands-on workshop in which we get up and move. Students create experiments and prototypes (both conceptual and technical) in response to weekly topics and design a body-centric final project based on what they've learned. Curated uses of the body (dance, physical comedy, sports, etc.), act as inspiration, but students focus on the everyman as the target user for the projects they create.

In the process of the studying how and why strangers interact in public, we address some of the abiding themes at ITP urban behavior, spontaneous interaction, the pleasure of the unexpected, how technology can mediate and/or enable human experience and we make a close and thorough examination of how they play out in this narrow slice of human experience. This approach is designed to bring students to a more concrete understanding of these larger abstract ideas. Classwork consists of readings, class discussions, field assignments (a series of assigned interactions with strangers that the students document and discuss) and an analytical final paper. Students learn how the interactions of strangers have changed historically (and why), what the experience of interaction with strangers means to the participants, how strangers ‘read’ each other, how they initiate interactions, how they avoid interactions, how they trust each other and how they fool each other. Readings range from seminal works on urban sociology and public behavior (Georg Simmel, Stanley Milgram, Erving Goffman, Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Elijah Anderson) to more lyrical examinations of strangers in cities (Tim Etchells, Italo Calvino, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Edgar Allan Poe) to recent neuropsychiatric discoveries about trust, mimicry, and flash judgments. Because stranger interactions are at heart a means to interrupt the expected narrative of the everyday, we consider the works of artists and thinkers who show how such disruption, surprise, spontaneity, and play are fundamental to the pleasure and substance of urban life, for example: the Situationists and their descendents, Sophie Calle, Marina Abramovic, Francis Alys, Graffiti Research Lab, Robert Rauschenberg, Survival Research Labs.

This course offers a new approach to materiality, positing that all matter is dynamic but exists within a continuum of control ranging from passively temporal (wood, water) to electronically active (photovoltaics, thermochromics) to biologically alive (plants, tissue). This course presents alternative design strategies for creating computational interfacing with living matter and state change of natural materials. Students are introduced to the world of the bio lab from a designer's perspective, both conceptually and practically. We examine the state-of-the-art in artistic experimentation with biological systems such as the genetic manipulation projects of Eduardo Kac, or the carbon nanotubes grown into architectural structures of Ryan Wartena. We also examine more DIY approaches to living systems integration and interactivity with biological systems. Students use a hands-on approach in their design process, with biological sensing as input and indicators or material state change as an alternative method of information display, for example. This course is designed to further our computational relationship with the natural world pushing forward ideas in sustainability, interactivity, energy production and the emerging relationship between the designer/artist and the bio lab, approaching biology as an open frontier for digital design.","instructor":["Parkes"],"credits":null,"year":2011,"words":[],"group":1},{"id":"course_439,2011","course":"course_439","title":"Information and Technology for Socio-Political Change","description":"If you saw radical injustice happening right in front of you, what would you do?

What are the design and implementation issues? If we view government as a “platform,” what does that mean for new interfaces? Are all governments a stable compilation? If not, what are the implications for interaction design? Is there any way to avoid bias in application design? How do we accommodate for those with whom we do not agree? How should transparency and security issues be properly balanced when these issues are translated in applications? What are the real tools that have been used or are being used right now to rectify injustice and bring positive social change? What have been their advantages and disadvantages, and how has political context defined their use? How does the digital divide modify the outcome? Together in this class we will look at live global case studies to answer these questions, from the viewpoint of the individual user of both government and technology. We will review underlying design issues around freedom of information and privacy, structured change vs. creative chaos, crisis-driven vs. long-term change, and strength in numbers vs. the value of dissent, all with an eye towards producing good new ideas for positive social change.

What types of sensors and communications devices are available? How do you hide the equipment in nesting places, feeding places, and other regularly visited spots? Can you attach tracking radios to the animals themselves without causing them hardship? How do you \"ruggedize\" the equipment? How do you gather data from the equipment you've placed regularly and reliably? These challenges are related to common interaction design problems with humans, so understanding and mastering them is valuable experience for interaction designers. For anthropologists, zoological, and veterinary researchers, understanding the technologies behind their tracking equipment, and the approach that technology designers take in developing and deploying these tools can benefit their research. The goal of this class is to give students an introduction to the technological challenges of tracking and observation of wildlife Specifically, students are presented with the challenges faced by Professor Anthony Di Fiore's research group in tracking spider monkeys in Ecuador. Students discuss the challenges associated with spider monkey research, survey the state of the art in animal tracking with a focus on appropriate tools for this research project, and work in groups to develop interactive prototypes to address one or more of these challenges. Our hope is that this class serves both to introduce students to the subject, and also develop some workable prototypes that could be developed further in future semesters, either through other research projects related to this particular work, or on their own. In order to realize the goals of this class, students have access to current tracking tools: radio collars, “ruggedized” cameras, microphones, and other current tracking technologies.

This change in the economics of communication has opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several profound effects in the media landscape today. This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries - newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking - faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.

We understand intuitively that networked computers differ from stand-alone computers, or that a group of friends differs from an aggregation of anonymous individuals, but describing that difference clearly is difficult. In particular, networks exhibit emergent characteristics that cannot be explained simply by examining their constituent parts. People are not like computers, but networks of people and networks of computers are alike in many ways. It is the organization of the respective networks that creates those similarities. Network Effects is a course about the structure of networks and how that structure affects human experience. We focus in particular on two invisible networks— communications networks and social networks. Communications networks are invisible in the traditional sense; their inner workings are hidden from us. We examine a variety of communications networks and explore the ways different networks affect the experiences of their users. Social networks are invisible in a different way; because we are so immersed in myriad social networks—friends, family, work, school—we don’t see them. We examine some of the structural elements of social networks, such as strong and weak ties, clustering, and small-worlds networks, to understand some of the ways that the shape of social networks affects us. The goal of the course is to synthesize observations about these two types of networks. Technological choices embodied in electronic networks profoundly affect their social dimensions: Why can we CC people on email but not on phone calls? How does the one-way network of television differ from the two-way network of the Internet? What effect does BitTorrent’s architectural decentralization have on its users? Social choices also affect the design of technology; resistance to spamming or attempts to hide from the RIAA have led to several deep technological changes in the design of blogs and file-sharing networks, respectively, changes that alter the social relations among the users. The class meetings center on discussion of readings and lectures. Outside class, students complete two short papers, a midterm project, and a final paper or project. The midterm project involves designing and implementing a small network (though not necessarily a computer- mediated one) and describing its effects. The final is a project or research interest of the student’s choice and involves designing, building, and describing a network; a visual and descriptive analysis of an existing network; or a research paper.","instructor":["Shirky"],"credits":null,"year":2013,"words":[],"group":9},{"id":"course_337,2013","course":"course_337","title":"Networked Expression","description":"In an ordinary conversation, a person’s body language registers as much as his or her spoken language.

However, in the case of a functional object, such as a product, a prescribed event does not reveal itself until the user interacts with it. Therefore, the design must solicit the user for desired action, which triggers the product’s functionality/experience. Here, the user’s experience is an inseparable element of the functional system. This course explores the nature of designing experience in three successive projects. First, various ways of describing experience are discussed. Second, students redesign an existing experience of a functional object, such as an ATM. Third, they design a new experience as a vehicle of integrating the user and novel functionality. Students are encouraged to explore new 2 vocabulary of interactivity, to expand the lexicon of interactive experience, and to examine the societal role of designing experience.","instructor":["Udagawa"],"credits":null,"year":2013,"words":["choreographing,2013"],"group":19},{"id":"course_186,2013","course":"course_186","title":"Dynamic Bodies","description":"We take the beauty of the dynamic world around us for granted.

The course encourages the student to experiment and develop a visual idea, more than to create finished work. Assignments include sketching out proposals for new work—storyboarding, for example—building a visual vocabulary through various forms of improvisation, as well as the more conventional practice of drawing from the model and still life. Students bring their knowledge of interactive telecommunications to drawing and find ways to let drawing enter into their design work. In this introductory drawing class students are urged to draw anything they want, exploring the freedom of expression that comes from playing with one’s imagination and memory and creating convincing imagery with or without references. The class will have informal critiques, and will visit galleries to look at contemporary art. Weekly assignments are required.

Designing such software is a problem that cannot be attacked in the same way as designing a word processor; designers of social software have more in common with economists or political scientists than they do with designers of single-user software, and operators of communal resources have more in common with politicians or landlords than with operators of ordinary Web sites. This course is based on the premise that we have only begun to figure out ways to support these new social patterns. The course begins with an overview of the 40-year history of social software and moves quickly to an examination of the tools and techniques available today, from blogs and wikis to RSS feeds and connectivity through Wi-Fi.

Who would be there? What would its main purpose be? Before you answer that question, let’s take a look back. The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside—amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go. The public was very limited; children were usually not allowed in. They were elitist institutions whose mission was archiving the past. Today, although most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors, there are fundamental ways—attitudes, techniques, structural issues—that are still lodged in the 19th century. Now, because of a very different kind of Cabinet of Wonder, i.e., the computer and other IT technologies, museums are able to display collections, demonstrate concepts, and reach their audiences in new ways. Most have not taken full advantage of these new tools or had the time to explore how they might change the nature of a museum visit, but we do in this course. We document together the ways in which technology may enhance the museum experience. We evaluate the use of interactive technologies in museums and how that experience might be extended online. But first we observe and study what they do now. We cannot invent a new wheel before we understand the old one. In this course, we explore the different kinds of exhibits in museums (object-based collection, demonstrations of phenomena), historic or single topic museums (e.g., the Tenement Museum), and the varied kinds of venues for exhibits (museums, trade shows, traveling, nature centers). Students learn through experience and discussion a brief history of museums and exhibitions and discover criteria for informal learning environments that differ from schoolroom learning. This course is an exploration, observation, and theory course. You are asked to visit specific museums: an iconic one of each type. These visits are your primary assignments— sometimes accompanied by a reading. A guest speaker from the assigned museum makes an in-class presentation and receives critiques from you. In the second half of the course, we begin to reinvent the museum. What is its purpose in the 21st century? How does the need for a curator change? We look at different museums’ efforts to use technology to take museums beyond the walls, to expand the notion of curators, to include people who don’t have access, or don’t know they do, to the places. And though we focus on museums, we also look at exhibits and other public displays of information. This is not a design or production course. The assignments are field trips to museums, readings, and writing.

To do this, students get firsthand experience unpacking particular visualizations, by talking with scientists and students of scientific disciplines, and by interviewing members of potential audiences. Who produces and analyses data, and what are they looking for in their results? Who else is interested in understanding data—and in what setting, through what medium or interface? From these direct experiences, students propose their own art/science collisions: using artistic sensibilities and media tools to communicate about the scientific process, contextualize and annotate visualizations, and frame the chosen topic for particular audiences: museumgoers, policy makers, the disabled, teachers, adults, or children. In periodic “science salons,” students discuss their chosen areas of science, associated datasets and visualizations, affiliated scientists, and potential audiences.

If you were to turn to a fellow student and say, “I do” or “I sentence you to five years in prison,” your listener would not become your spouse or be hustled off to Rikers. Nothing happens during a wedding or a sentencing hearing; those events are just special forms of talking. Yet talking, in those circumstances, creates real change in the world. There are two nested effects here—the inner one is the conditions under which speech becomes action, and the outer one is the ways we give groups the power to enforce those actions. Social software creates novel contexts for groups, but currently operates outside traditional social support for group action. For example, both corporations and online groups can have high degrees of internal cohesion and strive for external effects on the world, but corporations have the blessing of society, as an official “legal fiction,” to take actions that ordinary groups, no matter how cohesive, are forbidden to take. That gap is mainly one of tradition—one can readily imagine alternate “legal fictions” to support alternate kinds of groups. This course is centered around weekly readings and class discussions of primary materials, some historical, some current, revolving around four questions: What effect does social software have on groups who want to take action in the world? How do groups come to binding decisions about the action they want to take? What are the traditional supports and constraints for real-world groups (corporations, governments, NGOs, etc.) that act on the world?

We all understand why you shouldn’t throw out a credit card receipt with the card’s number on it without tearing it up, but should we be concerned with clicking on a link on a Web page? Sending an instant message? Opening a laptop to sign onto the wireless network at Starbucks? Maybe. Clicking on a Web page records your IP address on a Web server somewhere, instant messages are usually sent off unencrypted over the network, and opening a laptop usually requires negotiation with a DHCP server that records your computer’s unique identifier. Our devices and our online interactions leave a mark as unique as our fingerprints; thus, relevant questions are how can we turn those tables? What technologies can we create to trace information left by others? Given that openness is a core feature of the networks and technologies we use, what code, regulations, and etiquette make these usable? Weekly classes and assignments are balanced between background survey reading, technical reading, and hands-on experience all culminating in a final project.","instructor":["Krikorian"],"credits":null,"year":2013,"words":[],"group":9},{"id":"course_233,2013","course":"course_233","title":"Flash Back","description":"Programming is often viewed as an arcane art, an esoteric skill that is far removed from design and user experience.

It is natural that we try to emulate this on a computer. As a sensor the video camera is appealing, delivering up to 36 million bytes every second compared to maybe three bytes from a keyboard. Accessories and knowledge for using cameras are mainstream. For instance, by simply changing lenses, the same sensor once used for your fingers can now be aimed at a city block. Even very inexpensive computers are now fast enough to not only record frames of video but also to look through the individual pixels. It is no wonder cameras have become a standard accessory for computers (especially in cell phones). The difficulty of computer vision comes when you expect your software to be able to mimic the powers of the human brain to interpret arbitrary images. This course attempts to sidestep the difficult parts if you are willing to work in fairly contrived environments such as art installations, eye tracking rigs, or ant farms. The course covers software techniques for tracking objects in video, background removal, blob detection, as well as tricks on the optical side of the equation. Video tracking in real time requires a coding parsimony that can be used as a challenging method to improve a student’s overall coding skills. The course uses Java in the Eclipse environment, which is a good next step from the Processing environment.

In this course, students build on software and hardware tool kits to create hands-on experiments tapping less conscious parts of our experience. Initial topics include using a cell phone as personal sensor logger and visualizing the results; capturing subtle body language (e.g., eye-tracking) and transmitting it over a network; triggering and detecting subconscious activity (e.g., EEG); and the transition from communication to expression.

Interactivity, the passage of time, and resolution are just a few of the ideas that are being explored. Yet these ideas are new only in the sense that they are being adapted to new media. For example, in painting and sculpture, Renaissance and baroque artists used a variety of means to actively engage the viewer; the concept of continuous narrative, reaching back to the Egyptians, aims to convey the passage of time; and the notion of resolution has been variously interpreted by Titian, Seurat, Cézanne, de Kooning, Close, and many others. This course examines how artists throughout history have utilized various media and techniques to effect formal, conceptual, and experiential dynamics comparable to those being investigated by new media artists today. The goal of the course is not only to provide students with knowledge of the immensely rich history of artistic creativity, but also—and more important—to provide a platform through which that knowledge may be utilized to reconsider new media strategies of artistic expression. Through observation, discussion, reading, and projects (both written and hands-on), students acquire mental tools to approach their own work with an expanded understanding of artistic possibility.

These issues fall roughly into three categories: environment and ecology, economic development, and human rights equity. There are massive changes needed in all of these areas. The point of this two-unit seminar is to research and discuss how these issues relate to our work in interaction design and digital media production and to determine how the ITP community can have the most positive impact. In order to limit the scope of our research to something manageable within the semester, we focus mainly on environmental issues, starting with these central questions: What can we change here and now? What impact do our practices have on the environment, and what changes can we make to lessen the damage we do and increase any positive effects our work has? What skills or ideas do we bring to the table that can have the best effect? What are the most important things for a long-range sustainability program at ITP to focus on? In looking for answers to these questions, we attempt to address both our practice here at ITP and the assumptions we take with us into work and life after ITP. We build an online resource for ourselves and others based on what we learn in the process.

With digital technologies, one other constraint is our own ability to keep up with the ever-shifting tools that we use. Does this perpetual learning curve stifle our creative process? Or in contrast, can an abundance of technical know-how cloud a simple vision? The goal of this course is to make work that is fueled by the positive constraints (our audience, our vision) rather than the damaging ones (our lack of ability to know everything about the tools we use). Through weekly assignments, we draw ideas and production techniques from art, game design, music (sound art), cognitive science, and universal design toward an understanding of how to carry our initial ideas through a development process, without compromising quality and clarity of vision. For a final assignment, students are asked to create a project for a specific target audience, defined by age/gender/ race/culture and ability. The goal is to allow oneself a space for exploration while working toward a focused result. Some ideas for projects may include simplifying an application for the growing elderly population (can grandmama really use that fancy Nokia phone?), a software game based solely on audio (ever played Doom without a monitor in a dark room?), or an art piece that clearly conveys your artistic intentions with a digital medium (think of interactive art that’s not utterly frustrating/annoying for gallery goers).

When needed, software examples are programmed using Processing. We also use simple pcomp modules to quicken exploration (such as custom keyboard emulators).

The seminar functions as both an introduction to different CNC + prototyping equipment as well as a studio in which to test the possibilities and constraints of these new methods of production. Using 3D printing, laser cutting, and milling, we develop a language of “making” that can be brought to bear on two different scales: product and display wall. The seminar works within various scripting and modeling environments as a means to both work with form and translate form into real-world artifacts. Rather than take the world of objects at face value, we seek to develop transferable ways of working with form to actively question the shape and usage of mass-produced objects. As a starting point, we break down the world of “making” into certain procedures (i.e., perforating, extruding, folding) and extend the potential within each in a simple three dimensional piece, a “monad”—or indivisible unit. This language, as well as the qualities that emerge from the physical model, is then questioned in its correlation to existing objects. After developing an extremely acute formal language within this procedure, the student is challenged to pair it with a means of accumulation/assemblage (i.e., stacking, gluing, tabbing, nesting) that can negotiate a scale-shift from product scale to a display wall. We wish to emphasize the relation to the idea of algorithmic development (i.e., a simple unit that is “grown” or repetitively made) is partially brought about through the simplistic operation of CNC prototyping equipment in the sense that they incrementally cut, deposit, or remove material. We do not focus on the “natural” or “biomorphic” aspects of this, but rather look at how these operations are deployed in objects all around us.

From kinetic sculptures to modern architecture, from product design to interactive art, learning how to create sound mechanical interfaces between inputs and outputs to a system helps us interpret and interact with our environments. There is little use in building effective circuitry for physical computing if the mechanism to be controlled is too weak to handle the task set forth for it. Systems can also be optimized and protected from expensive over-engineering with a basic knowledge of mechanics and materials.

When we ask “What is user-generated content?”, one of the surprising answers is that the literal definition of the term is useless. If you open a copy of Word and create a file, it isn’t “user-generated content.” If Stephen King opens Word and writes a book, that isn’t it either. Somehow your local file doesn’t count, while it isn’t a surprise that Mr. King’s novel finds readers. When we talk about user-generated content, and indeed user-generated anything, we are actually talking about a theory of social relations—user-generated content can’t be done by professionals and must have an audience. This course looks at both examples and theories of user-generated content, including blogging, wikis, online photos and video, and even user-generated editorial judgment and categorization systems.","instructor":["Shirky"],"credits":null,"year":2013,"words":[],"group":14},{"id":"course_276,2013","course":"course_276","title":"2x2","description":"Form follows format. The first movies were filmed plays; it took decades for the vocabulary of film and a new kind of storytelling to emerge. Now film is viewable on handheld devices (phones, palms, iPods, MP3 players), and people are watching movies on these devices that are meant for the big screen and a communal experience (theater), or they are watching short-format forms, such as commercials and music videos, which are meant for TV and whose purpose is selling stuff. Will a new art form emerge out of this? Will there be a new vocabulary? Will visuals become less important? Sound more important? Can one be moved to action, to tears, to laughter in a short time and small space? Can one possibly feel immersed? 2X2 is an experiment—a creative storytelling/ narrative course exploring a potential new art form, specifically designed to be seen on a small (+/- 2 inches) screen for a short time (+/- 2 minutes). Emphasis is on story, not production, not interaction, not theory. We explore narrative possibilities in both nonfiction (e.g., essay forms, minidocs) and fiction (e.g., stories, poetry, performance). In some assignments, students work with other people’s stories; in others, they create their own. In a collaboration created for this course, students have access to and permission to use the Magnum Photo archive (www.magnumphotos.com). The class follows a “creative writing” style format. Each week there are two assignments. These are quick sketches/rough drafts; a specific exercise is given at the end of each class, which has two aspects: a topic/theme (e.g., confess to an emotional crime), and a form restriction (e.g., use no words). In each class, students present their work for critique. Every week each student adds an episode, randomly assigned, to someone else’s story created the previous week. For a final project, each student picks two of their individual assignments (one fiction, one nonfiction) to take to a more finished level. The last class is a film festival with outside reviewers.","instructor":["Hechinger"],"credits":null,"year":2013,"words":[],"group":0},{"id":"course_277,2013","course":"course_277","title":"Metaforms","description":"Meta-forms is a studio course offering a broad range of topics focused on progressive architectural discourse framed by new media. The goal of the course is for each student to produce an architectural form which inhabits an urban public space in New York City. The forms need not be traditional architectural constructs, but new strategies towards defining an architecture that can be expressed through new technologies. Students are encouraged to imagine the impossible and to integrate meta-forms into the contemporary city. Science fiction sites, transportation paths, urban anomalies, invisible boundaries, and temporary autonomous zone are examined and developed as meta-form habitats. The semester long project is divided into two parts: expressions and interventions. The first section, expressions, addresses contemporary architectural tendencies that unfold to inhabit the spaces of urban environments. The second part, interventions, activates communication strategies to connect the meta-forms to actual public spaces within New York City. The class work culminates in final presentations critiqued by guest reviewers from related fields. No prerequisites or architectural experience is needed, however, previous knowledge of at least one programming language is strongly recommended (Processing, MaxMSP/Jitter, Maya, Flash etc.).

We begin the process with prototyping with breadboards, perforated boards, and etched boards. The final circuit is designed using the Eagle PCB software. Other topics covered in the course include circuit serial programming; the many package types of components and the benefits they add to a circuit; and surface mount soldering using a hot air bath.

Basically, the course integrates Pcomp and Computational Media into the history of drawing and human ideas about the drawing process—and puts them in context. Students explore drawing in whatever medium they choose, it need not be technological— the idea is to generate a “working tool set.” This could mean exploring a certain aspect of MaxMSP or Processing or Arduino for example. The point is that drawing is an oddly physical and intellectual activity—one can’t have one without the other. Can we bring some of this “physicalness” into how we understand our technological tools? Also, can we begin thinking about the sketchbook as a “machine for ideas?” The course is as much about “drawing machines” as it is about developing/refining a creative process.

If we can only perceive these things through mediation (media representations), then how we represent them is the fundamental question, reflecting our ideologies, prejudices, hopes, and fears. Do we speak for animals, and if so what are we saying for them? Are they friends, pets, environmental equals, or beasts? How are hybrid monsters (chimera) created and what do they mean?

In Thinking Physically, we work to open ourselves back up and embrace the rich capabilities and inherent expressiveness of the human form. Starting with the body itself, we think about how it works and take a brief look at motion studies and biomechanics. Next, we examine how we use our bodies to relate to each other, considering physical social perceptions, proxemics, and cultural contexts. We then work to become better listeners, striving to sense the subtleties of body language, gesture, and nonverbal communication. Finally, it’s time to put those listening skills to work, designing interfaces that perceive the body’s communicative nature and encourage people to interact in a more physical way. Thinking Physically is a hands-on workshop in which we get up and move. Students create experiments and prototypes (both conceptual and technical) in response to weekly topics and design a body-centric final project based on what they’ve learned.

Technical topics include display integration techniques, vision-based sensing, physical sensing, and methods of fabrication. Students will work in pairs to complete two large projects over the course of the semester. These projects are evaluated on both the quality of the design and the success of implementation. Additionally, there are weekly assignments that challenge students to consider a wide variety of spaces that are ripe for transformation through the integration of digital media.

This course takes an analytical approach to unraveling and understanding these charged moments. In the process of the studying how and why strangers interact in public, we address some of the abiding themes at ITP— urban behavior, spontaneous interaction, the pleasure of the unexpected, how technology can mediate and/or enable human experience—and we make a close and thorough examination of how they play out in this narrow slice of human experience. This approach is designed to bring students to a more concrete understanding of these larger abstract ideas. Classwork consists of readings, class discussions, field assignments (a series of assigned interactions with strangers that the students document and discuss) and an analytical final paper. Students learn how the interactions of strangers have changed historically (and why), what the experience of interaction with strangers means to the participants, how strangers ‘read’ each other, how they initiate interactions, how they avoid interactions, how they trust each other and how they fool each other. Readings range from seminal works on urban sociology and public behavior (Georg Simmel, Stanley Milgram, Erving Goffman, Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Elijah Anderson) to more lyrical examinations of strangers in cities (Tim Etchells, Italo Calvino, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Edgar Allan Poe) to recent neuropsychiatric discoveries about trust, mimicry, and flash judgments. Because stranger interactions are at heart a means to interrupt the expected narrative of the everyday, we consider the works of artists and thinkers who show how such disruption, surprise, spontaneity, and play are fundamental to the pleasure and substance of urban life, for example: the Situationists and their descendents, Sophie Calle, Marina Abramovic, Francis Alys, Graffiti Research Lab, Robert Rauschenberg, Survival Research Labs.

In this course, we survey the major work that has been done to understand games, both digital and traditional, in the past sixty years. Starting with foundational texts by historian Johan Huizinga and sociologist Roger Caillois, up to the present day where movements like ‘New Games Journalism’ seek to place games in the more personal context of a single human life. While the class seeks to understand games from theoretical and historical perspectives, the focus is on students bringing their own interpretations to bear.

As the available inputs and UI change with each device, so does the content, design limitations, and the narrative. We currently live in a world where we interact with content in three main environments: one foot—cell phone/iPod, two foot—computer, and 10-foot—television and with each of these devices we have to accommodate our content and interaction accordingly, and allow for the content to follow the user between these devices, but maintain a classic and intuitive user experience.

Furthermore, we examine the power of persuasive technologies in creating opportunities for communicating nonhuman intentions and viewpoints. Readings range from Douglas Adams on Genuine People Personalities, to Frank Herbert’s Without Me, You’re Nothing, Friedrich Juenger’s The Failure of Technology, to BJ Fogg, Nass, and Rives, and the work in Critical Design by Dunne and Raby, among others.

Since then, every new technology of connection produces new ways of initiating, enriching and sustaining intimacy. These new developments are often perceived simultaneously as creating distance and bridging distance. Because the invention of technologies of intimacy is a perennial pursuit at ITP, the goal of the class is to enrich students’ ability to create meaningful and successful projects related to intimacy. Students gain a studied and nuanced understanding of the idea of intimacy and the physical and emotional experiences associated with it— as well as examining how existing and cutting edge technologies work to connect intimates across the physical and metaphorical distances they routinely experience in everyday life. The first section of the course is devoted to studying intimacy, bonding, attachment, longing and desire from a variety of perspectives. These include psychology and psychoanalysis— e.g.: Freud, Erich Fromm, Lacan, Kristeva, John Bowlby on attachment, Jessica Benjamin on bonding, Donald Winnicott on intersubjectivity; recent neuroscience, neurochemistry, and evolutionary biology related to intimacy and bonding; and recent psychological work specifically regarding intimacy and the internet. The second section of the course focuses on current art and technology projects—along with commercial ventures—that explore mediated intimacy across distances (the examples are legion). We scrutinize these projects to understand what they do right and what they do wrong. And we investigate the language and syntax of mediated intimacy, including attempts to incorporate each of (or combinations of) the human senses into devices of connectedness. In seeking to articulate what makes a meaningful mediated experience of intimacy, the course also looks at a group of edge cases—for example, personal performances in public (from web-cam girls to performance art)—that support asymmetrical intimacies.

Can you attach tracking radios to the animals themselves without causing them hardship? How do you “ruggedize” the equipment? How do you gather data from the equipment you’ve placed regularly and reliably? These challenges are related to common interaction design problems with humans, so understanding and mastering them is valuable experience for interaction designers. For anthropologists, zoological, and veterinary researchers, understanding the technologies behind their tracking equipment, and the approach that technology designers take in developing and deploying these tools can benefit their research. The goal of this class is to give students an introduction to the technological challenges of tracking and observation of wildlife. Specifically, students are presented with the challenges faced by Professor Anthony Di Fiore’s research group in tracking spider monkeys in Ecuador. Students discuss the challenges associated with spider monkey research, survey the state of the art in animal tracking with a focus on appropriate tools for this research project, and work in groups to develop interactive prototypes to address one or more of these challenges. Our hope is that this class serves both to introduce students to the subject, and also develop some workable prototypes that could be developed further in future semesters, either through other research projects related to this particular work, or on their own. In order to realize the goals of this class, students have access to current tracking tools: radio collars, “ruggedized” cameras, microphones, and other current tracking technologies.

Our central question is: what are the minimum requirements for creating an impression of authenticity in an environment, place, character, machine, person or responsive system? Overall, we learn strategies for creating richer and more subtle technology projects that ask users or participants for their contingent acceptance of the project’s reality. Coursework includes weekly readings, field experiments, and short papers. The semester is split into two overarching themes — the first is Humanness. When we attribute human-esque responsiveness or behavioral and emotional characteristics to a non-human, what cognitive processes are we engaging? What are some of the most persuasive signals of humanness, signals that are powerful enough to convey humanness even in the absence of other cues? Topics and readings include: • Establishing a working definition of authenticity; • The uncanny (Freud); • Theory of mind, intuition, empathy (Selections from The Missing Link in Cognition, on primates); • Dead or Alive (Mary Shelley, Frankenstein; other monsters); • Projection: animism & anthropomorphizing (Sherry Turkle, Pascal Boyer); • Responsive machines (various studies of social and humanoid robots). The second is Identities and environments. What is authenticity of person or of place? By what cues do we attribute authenticity to individual identities and constructed environments? How many or few cues does it take for us to read a system, a person, a constructed world as authentic? What lessons for technology makers are to be learned by investigating abnormal psychology, world-building, and manipulated truth/trust? Topics and readings include: • Broken perception— delusions of false worlds (selections on misidentification syndromes, e.g. Cotard’s, Fregoli delusion, reduplicative paramnesia, Capgras); • Unreality in unreal systems/environments (Coraline, Metal Snake/Ps ycho Mantis [game], Philip K.

It can be inherent to the process--even a key aspect--of reaching a desired outcome for participants. Discomfort with good reason. This is the starting point for this course. In The Art of Interactive Design, Chris Crawford makes an analogy between creating interactive media and holding a conversation. A standard design process often looks to set up \"conversations\" that are comfortable and pleasurable, with a low barrier to entry for users. But in pursuit of meaningful growth, we need to engineer what Douglas Stone at Harvard Law has termed \"Difficult Conversations\". As designers, artists, and creative-technologists, we can find unique insights and devise innovative solutions for leading people through them. Weekly lectures and assignments will focus on identifying and prototyping creative experiences that involve one of four forms of discomfort (visceral, cultural, control-related, and intimacy-related). Examples will be considered from fields including visual art, performance, memorials, product design, and speculative design.

Immersive Listening: Designing Sound for VR - 2.0 Units ITPG.GT.2022.001 T. K. Broderick Until recently 3D sound was a novelty reserved for special uses and reaching a limited audience, no medium in popular culture has been as inherently dependent upon spatial audio as virtual reality. The widespread and standardized implementation of surround sound in film brought cinema to a new level of immersion, but is limited to theatrical exhibition and home theater systems. Today a considerable amount of content is consumed on mobile devices and laptops which excludes the cinematic experience of spatial sound. With the current rise of cinematic VR and the blurring line between gaming and experiential VR, spatial audio is no longer just an added bonus, but rather a necessity in designing immersive VR experiences. In this course we will explore the emerging field of 3D sound design and for both 360 video and game engine-built VR using a digital audio workstation, game engines, and 3D audio plugins.

Students experiment using low cost, hands-on tips and tricks in software and hardware to capture high dynamic range, expanded color, night color, 3D, time lapse, and stop motion images using a digital camera and printer. While using mostly off-the-shelf tools, these experiments require students to dig down to see the nitty-gritty of today's and tomorrow's technologies for digitally sensing, encoding, compressing, transmitting and displaying images.","instructor":["Eric Rosenthal"],"credits":null,"year":2018,"words":[],"group":2},{"id":"course_502,2018","course":"course_502","title":"Fandom","description":"Doctor Who. Anime. PBR. Why are we into the things we're into? The modern rise in nerd culture has changed the way we think about fans and the way they act. Geekiness, once a mark of stigma, has transformed into an important focus for creators, marketers, and a million internet celebs. Fandom is the study of the communities that form around popular culture, whether based on a shared love of Star Wars, the New York Yankees, Taylor Swift, or 3D printing. Good fan management can lead to hordes of adoring, evangelical users; bad fan interactions can spell shame and embarrassment. From Pokemon to Air Jordans, this class explores the influences and motivations that have led to the current renaissance in fandom. We chart the evolution of fan culture as a social and economic force, from early 15th century religious manias to its present rebirth in the age of digital connectivity and anonymity. Commercialization, appropriation, monetization, love-bombing, all of these are important tools for any project creator who wants to inspire large groups of people to do their bidding.","instructor":["Zoe Fraade-Blanar"],"credits":null,"year":2018,"words":["manias,2018","geekiness,2018"],"group":6},{"id":"course_503,2018","course":"course_503","title":"Game Design and the Psychology of Choice","description":"As game and interaction designers we create systems and choices that can either prey upon our psychological foibles or help us avoid decision pitfalls. It is our responsibility to understand how we decide, to consider the ethics of the systems we create and to practice designing systems in a purposeful manner. Game Design & The Psychology of Choice will provide interaction and game designers with an understanding of the factors that influence behavior and decision-making by looking at the intertwining of cognitive psychology and economics through the development of behavioral economics. These disciplines study behavior on the individual and group level, often revealing some of the why behind the rules of thumb and folk wisdom that game designers come to intuitively. But understanding the why-why we fall into decision traps; why certain tradeoffs tax our brain more than others; why we are overconfident about our abilities; why certain decisions make us uncomfortable-allows us to more purposefully apply our design craft, both in and out of games. Finally, as a class, we will take what we learn about how we think and create series of game experiences based around key cognitive science concepts.

Neither class is a prerequisite for the other, however. The 2-point version of this class will introduce network connection techniques for devices using microcontrollers like the MKR1000 or ESP8266 and processors running an embedded operating system like the Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone. You will have 4 assignments in this class. Weeks 4 and 5 are the same assignment, on different platforms. You'll be assigned a platform by coin toss or volunteer in week 4, so that we have an equal number of projects on each platform. Learning Objectives: Students will gain an understanding of the basics of client-server web-based programming for devices with limited computing power. They will learn about current protocols for communication between devices and web servers, and about the rudiments of security for that communication.","instructor":["Igoe"],"credits":null,"year":2018,"words":[],"group":12},{"id":"course_530,2018","course":"course_530","title":"Designing Games for Kids","description":"Making games for kids ain't easy, but it sure can be rewarding. Kids can be the harshest of critics and also the most appreciative of players. Designing a game entails crafting a complex and dynamic system to produce engagement. Designing games for kids demands that you do all of that and make it look super simple. No 20 page booklets of rules. No relying on the good will of the player to hold their attention. Stir in the reality that a 4-year old is radically different from a 7-year old and you've got a formidable, but exciting design challenge in front of you. Designing games for kids forces you to strip your games down to their essence honing your skills as an interaction designer. This class will lay out a basic framework for game design. Then we'll use that framework to analyze and design games for different age ranges, skill levels and attention spans. We will also look at the interplay between games and education, focusing on ways to draw out learning through scaffolding. The class will focus heavily on production and playtesting.

With the accelerated pace of technological innovation it is becoming harder to keep pace with the impact technology has on our lives and the way we relate with each other - objects in the mirror are beginning to coincide with the mirror. Creating future scenarios gives us agency, makes us realize the power and responsibility we have in longterm planning, and opens up the space for a rigorous conversation on ethics, design, toolmaking, privacy, authenticity, and other issues. Good scenario planning considers not just one, but multiple, carefully researched views of the future, comparing and contrasting them to decide on a course of action. As Peter Schwartz points out in The Art of the Long View, \"the point is to make strategic decisions that will be sound for all plausible futures.... The end result, [of scenario planning], is not an accurate picture of tomorrow, but better decisions about the future.\" Scenario planning using a systems view changes the way we see not only the future, but how we make decisions about the present as well. In this class, students will develop skills in future scenario planning grounded in systems thinking and research about the present and the past. We will work together to determine a question that concerns us about our future five to ten years forward. From there, we will articulate factors that are relevant to the question: driving forces, current conditions and trends which can be extrapolated, and critical uncertainties. Using this research as both source material and constraint, students will split into groups to develop multiple scenarios describing the future date which the class is examining. Final projects will be a series of live group presentations of your scenario, with multimedia support as needed. By the end of the class, students will: Strengthen their ability to research technologies and their effects Become familiar with systems thinking as a tool for planning and design Gain a familiarity with current approaches to scenario planning (e.g. Royal Dutch Shell, SRI, IFTF, etc.) Strengthen both written and in-person presentation skills","instructor":["Papadopoulos","Igoe"],"credits":null,"year":2018,"words":["toolmaking,2018","iftf,2018"],"group":17},{"id":"course_539,2018","course":"course_539","title":"Hacking the Browser","description":"Web browsers were originally only used for displaying web pages, but over the years they have become supercharged all-powerful web execution machines.

The invention of alphabets allowed for broad literacy and then the moveable type of the printing press ignited the enlightenment. The arrival of DNA allowed for our diversity and evolution of all life forms. Motion pictures, perhaps our most convincing medium, is now undergoing such a transformation thanks to virtual reality technologies. The iconic immersive headset is a distraction compare to the VR technologies for scanning, modeling and rendering reality using shared, reusable elements instead of just pixels. Specifically we will look at tools like depth cameras that can gather foreground elements like people and props from a scene so they can be rearranged or substituted separately from the background. Superimposing panoramic video or rendered backgrounds can save the need to pull up a army of truck and crew to shoot on location and by allowing directors to later change their shot angles rather than pulling up the truck again to reshoot. New scanning, avatar generation and libraries of 3D objects has saved you the need of the army of modelers you see in 20 minutes of credits roll at the end of a sci fi movie. These scanning capabilities as well as the ability to realtime render those models is finding its way into small inexpensive devices like the phones that most people in the world are carrying around in their pocket. All of these cover the visible parts of cinema but we will also discuss how the less visible structure of story, the plots and sequences might be templated into reusable formulas for non experts to find emotionally satisfying dramatic arcs. Most importantly cinema is made more out of reusable, shared elements and templates, it becomes comparable and conversational. You could find exactly how your story overlaps and intersects with other in a shared \"space\" of stories. In particular AI technology shows promise in finding clusters of similar compositions across the many permutations of possible stories. This would make it more fun to share your construction of reality with friends but also potentially more responsible that your construction of reality has to be put in context of others. The purpose of this class is not for professional film directors (and politicians) who have already discovered these new tools for publishing their constructions of reality. Instead this class is about the true potential of virtual reality, its mutability, to put ordinary users in the role of director as they already are in their dreams and fantasies. The course will emphasize tools like cameras that for capturing the user's expression with the results display in conventional 16:9 format over tools of immersion like headsets that emphasize pushing thing to the person. The aesthetic will be rough juxtapositions in the traditions of comics, cubism, collage, storyboards and previs that quickly capture the your interior space without being slavish to verisimilitude of cartesian 3D scenes. Most importantly the output must delivered in the unflattened open source formats of the web where every element remains discrete and addressable with a URL.

Has the revolutionary impact of digital media produced entirely independent spaces of art making and creativity? Thinking around such questions tends toward historical dialectic, or the idea that the present is always in dialogue with the past. There is a long history of ties between the making of art and technological advancement. Taking this history as its foundation, this course will explore how digital technologies have produced new arenas for artistic expression and interpretation, while focusing on how 20th-century artists working before the digital boom utilized other media, techniques and approaches to effect comparable formal, conceptual and experiential dynamics. The course has been designed to enhance perception and understanding of art through a variety of channels - from sustained, close looking to exploratory conversations to more rigorous thinking and discussions informed by readings, projects (including making projects) and written assignments.","instructor":["Krantz"],"credits":null,"year":2018,"words":[],"group":0},{"id":"course_556,2018","course":"course_556","title":"Rest of You","description":"You live with illusions. The nature of these illusions has long been described in mystical practices but is now increasing corroborated by modern research such as neuroscience, behavioral economics, social psychology, embodied cognition and evolutionary psychology. What does this have to do with computational media? With technology do we have the ability to revisit some of the illusions that made sense for natural selection of your genes in other contexts but that might limit our personal happiness or the overall functioning of society. Will the computer's ability to run more objective statistical analysis on data gathered tirelessly over time, across individuals and locations allow us to more accurately see ourselves and the world as it is. Can we build computer interfaces that give a fuller expression of our experience when we are not limited by an illusory view of ourselves? The insights into how into how to reach people more fully comes with a responsibility to then ask what should say to them. As the computers are able to understand us better than we understand ourselves will we relinquish control to them? At a practical level the class looks at interfaces for capturing the less consciously controlled parts of your body using things like biosensors and cameras. Then we look at such things as subliminal displays for reaching past the normal conscious model of human understanding. It then moves on to trying to find meaning in the mounds of already digitized expression you have produced everyday for years in emails, text etc.... Finally we will look at how we can manipulate shared media, for instance using browser extensions, to see if we can get beyond vestigial antisocial ways of perceiving the world.

We're trading an increasingly hostile natural environment for a socially networked and commercially driven artificial one. Whether it's the bedrooms of YouTube streaming stars, the augmented Pokestops of Pokemon Go, the virtual tourism of the latest humanitarian crisis or even the \"airspace\" of Airbnb; we are witnessing a dramatic transformation of what occupying space means. So where are these dramatic spatial paradigm shifts occurring? Who owns and occupies these spaces? Who are the architects and what historical and ethical foundations are they working from? What world do they want to build for humanity and where does the creative individual fit into it? Will it be a walled garden, a role-playing adventure or a tool for creating more worlds? The course will ask students to embrace the role of virtual architect, not in the traditional brick-and-mortar sense of constructing shelter, but in terms of the engagement with the raw concept of space. However this virtual space must be considered and evaluated as a \"site\" that is activated and occupied by real people and all the limitations of physical space that they bring with them from the real world. This is the foundation of synthetic architecture; simulated space met with biological perception. This conceptual architecture is free from the confines of physics but host to a whole new set of questions : How do we embrace the human factors of a dimensionless environment? How do we make or encourage meaningful interactions within the limits of current technology? New models of interaction must inform and shape the architecture of virtual space - what does that look like? How can architecture and aesthetics inform the creation of virtual environments and immersive narratives? How do we acutely consider the psychological and social impacts of the worlds we design and what is the metaphorical ground plane to make sense of this virtual world, unbound by physics? In addition to close examination of these questions via lecture, reading and discussion, the course is highly experimental and production-heavy; students greatly benefit from prior knowledge of 3d modeling/rendering software (Maya, C4D, Max) and current game engines (Unity, Unreal). Focus will be on designing and developing VR experiences for the HTC VIVE, however the lessons learned are applicable to other VR, AR and interactive formats. Students should be prepared to be intrigued and frustrated by this emerging medium, and will be encouraged to become a part of the current VR dialog, recognizing that the standards for constructing and interacting with virtual worlds are still very much undefined. Ultimately students should walk away with a personal virtual world building language that communicates his or her intended values and aesthetics.","instructor":["Turner"],"credits":null,"year":2018,"words":[],"group":5},{"id":"course_561,2018","course":"course_561","title":"Tangible Interaction Workshop","description":"Tangible interfaces are interfaces that you touch.
